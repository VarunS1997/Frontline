jump on to a horse  some sickly grass-patches in the big yard 
but mostly it was bare and smooth  like an old hat with the nap rubbed
off  big double log-house for the white folks hewed logs  with the
chinks stopped up with mud or mortar  and these mud-stripes been
whitewashed some time or another  round-log kitchen  with a big broad 
open but roofed passage joining it to the house  log smoke-house back of
the kitchen  three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the
smoke-house  one little hut all by itself away down against the back
fence  and some outbuildings down a piece the other side  ash-hopper and
big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut  bench by the kitchen door 
with bucket of water and a gourd  hound asleep there in the sun  more
hounds asleep round about  about three shade trees away off in a corner 
some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence 
outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch  then the cotton
fields begins  and after the fields the woods 

i went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper  and
started for the kitchen   when i got a little ways i heard the dim hum of
a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again  and then
i knowed for certain i wished i was dead for that is the lonesomest
sound in the whole world 

i went right along  not fixing up any particular plan  but just trusting
to providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come  for
i'd noticed that providence always did put the right words in my mouth if
i left it alone 

when i got half-way  first one hound and then another got up and went for
me  and of course i stopped and faced them  and kept still   and such
another powwow as they made!  in a quarter of a minute i was a kind of a
hub of a wheel  as you may say spokes made out of dogs circle of
fifteen of them packed together around me  with their necks and noses
stretched up towards me  a-barking and howling  and more a-coming  you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres 

a nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her
hand  singing out   begone you tige! you spot! begone sah!  and she
fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling 
and then the rest followed  and the next second half of them come back 
wagging their tails around me  and making friends with me   there ain't
no harm in a hound  nohow 

and behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts  and they hung on to their
mother's gown  and peeped out from behind her at me  bashful  the way
they always do   and here comes the white woman running from the house 
about forty-five or fifty year old  bareheaded  and her spinning-stick in
her hand  and behind her comes her little white children  acting the same
way the little niggers was going   she was smiling all over so she could
hardly stand and says 

 it's you  at last! ain't it  

i out with a  yes'm  before i thought 

she grabbed me and hugged me tight  and then gripped me by both hands and
shook and shook  and the tears come in her eyes  and run down over  and
she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough  and kept saying   you don't
look as much like your mother as i reckoned you would  but law sakes  i
don't care for that  i'm so glad to see you!  dear  dear  it does seem
like i could eat you up!  children  it's your cousin tom! tell him
howdy  

but they ducked their heads  and put their fingers in their mouths  and
hid behind her   so she run on 

 lize  hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away or did you get
your breakfast on the boat  

i said i had got it on the boat   so then she started for the house 
leading me by the hand  and the children tagging after   when we got
there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair  and set herself down on
a little low stool in front of me  holding both of my hands  and says 

 now i can have a good look at you  and  laws-a-me  i've been hungry for
it a many and a many a time  all these long years  and it's come at last!
we been expecting you a couple of days and more   what kep' you  boat
get aground  

 yes'm she  

 don't say yes'm say aunt sally   where'd she get aground  

i didn't rightly know what to say  because i didn't know whether the boat
would be coming up the river or down   but i go a good deal on instinct 
and my instinct said she would be coming up from down towards orleans 
that didn't help me much  though  for i didn't know the names of bars
down that way   i see i'd got to invent a bar  or forget the name of the
one we got aground on or now i struck an idea  and fetched it out 

 it warn't the grounding that didn't keep us back but a little   we
blowed out a cylinder-head  

 good gracious! anybody hurt  

 no'm   killed a nigger  

 well  it's lucky  because sometimes people do get hurt   two years ago
last christmas your uncle silas was coming up from newrleans on the old
lally rook  and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man   and i
think he died afterwards   he was a baptist   your uncle silas knowed a
family in baton rouge that knowed his people very well   yes  i remember
now  he did die   mortification set in  and they had to amputate him 
but it didn't save him   yes  it was mortification that was it   he
turned blue all over  and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection 
they say he was a sight to look at   your uncle's been up to the town
every day to fetch you  and he's gone again  not more'n an hour ago 
he'll be back any minute now  you must a met him on the road  didn't
you  oldish man  with a  

 no  i didn't see nobody  aunt sally   the boat landed just at daylight 
and i left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town
and out a piece in the country  to put in the time and not get here too
soon  and so i come down the back way  

 who'd you give the baggage to  

 nobody  

 why  child  it 'll be stole! 

 not where i hid it i reckon it won't   i says 

 how'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat  

it was kinder thin ice  but i says 

 the captain see me standing around  and told me i better have something
to eat before i went ashore  so he took me in the texas to the officers'
lunch  and give me all i wanted  

i was getting so uneasy i couldn't listen good   i had my mind on the
children all the time  i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them
a little  and find out who i was   but i couldn't get no show  mrs 
phelps kept it up and run on so   pretty soon she made the cold chills
streak all down my back  because she says 

 but here we're a-running on this way  and you hain't told me a word
about sis  nor any of them   now i'll rest my works a little  and you
start up yourn  just tell me everything tell me all about 'm all every
one of 'm  and how they are  and what they're doing  and what they told
you to tell me  and every last thing you can think of  

well  i see i was up a stump and up it good   providence had stood by me
this fur all right  but i was hard and tight aground now   i see it
warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand   so
i says to myself  here's another place where i got to resk the truth   i
opened my mouth to begin  but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the
bed  and says 

 here he comes!  stick your head down lower there  that'll do  you can't
be seen now   don't you let on you're here   i'll play a joke on him 
children  don't you say a word  

i see i was in a fix now   but it warn't no use to worry  there warn't
nothing to do but just hold still  and try and be ready to stand from
under when the lightning struck 

i had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in  then
the bed hid him   mrs  phelps she jumps for him  and says 

 has he come  

 no   says her husband 

 good-ness gracious!  she says   what in the warld can have become of
him  

 i can't imagine   says the old gentleman   and i must say it makes me
dreadful uneasy  

 uneasy!  she says   i'm ready to go distracted!  he must a come  and
you've missed him along the road   i know it's so something tells me
so  

 why  sally  i couldn't miss him along the road you know that  

 but oh  dear  dear  what will sis say!  he must a come!  you must a
missed him   he  

 oh  don't distress me any more'n i'm already distressed   i don't know
what in the world to make of it   i'm at my wit's end  and i don't mind
acknowledging 't i'm right down scared   but there's no hope that he's
come  for he couldn't come and me miss him   sally  it's terrible just
terrible something's happened to the boat  sure! 

 why  silas!  look yonder! up the road! ain't that somebody coming  

he sprung to the window at the head of the bed  and that give mrs  phelps
the chance she wanted   she stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and
give me a pull  and out i come  and when he turned back from the window
there she stood  a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire  and i
standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside   the old gentleman stared  and
says 

 why  who's that  

 who do you reckon 't is  

 i hain't no idea   who is it  

 it's tom sawyer! 

by jings  i most slumped through the floor!  but there warn't no time to
swap knives  the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook  and kept on
shaking  and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
cry  and then how they both did fire off questions about sid  and mary 
and the rest of the tribe 

but if they was joyful  it warn't nothing to what i was  for it was like
being born again  i was so glad to find out who i was   well  they froze
to me for two hours  and at last  when my chin was so tired it couldn't
hardly go any more  i had told them more about my family i mean the
sawyer family than ever happened to any six sawyer families   and i
explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of
white river  and it took us three days to fix it   which was all right 
and worked first-rate  because they didn't know but what it would take
three days to fix it   if i'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just
as well 

now i was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side  and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other   being tom sawyer was easy and
comfortable  and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river   then i says to myself  s'pose
tom sawyer comes down on that boat   and s'pose he steps in here any
minute  and sings out my name before i can throw him a wink to keep
quiet 

well  i couldn't have it that way  it wouldn't do at all   i must go up
the road and waylay him   so i told the folks i reckoned i would go up to
the town and fetch down my baggage   the old gentleman was for going
along with me  but i said no  i could drive the horse myself  and i
druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me 




so i started for town in the wagon  and when i was half-way i see a wagon
coming  and sure enough it was tom sawyer  and i stopped and waited till
he come along   i says  hold on!  and it stopped alongside  and his mouth
opened up like a trunk  and stayed so  and he swallowed two or three
times like a person that's got a dry throat  and then says 

 i hain't ever done you no harm   you know that   so  then  what you want
to come back and ha'nt me for  

i says 

 i hain't come back i hain't been gone  

when he heard my voice it righted him up some  but he warn't quite
satisfied yet   he says 

 don't you play nothing on me  because i wouldn't on you   honest injun 
you ain't a ghost  

 honest injun  i ain't   i says 

 well i i well  that ought to settle it  of course  but i can't
somehow seem to understand it no way   looky here  warn't you ever
murdered at all  

 no   i warn't ever murdered at all i played it on them   you come in
here and feel of me if you don't believe me  

so he done it  and it satisfied him  and he was that glad to see me again
he didn't know what to do   and he wanted to know all about it right off 
because it was a grand adventure  and mysterious  and so it hit him where
he lived   but i said  leave it alone till by and by  and told his driver
to wait  and we drove off a little piece  and i told him the kind of a
fix i was in  and what did he reckon we better do   he said  let him
alone a minute  and don't disturb him   so he thought and thought  and
pretty soon he says 

 it's all right  i've got it   take my trunk in your wagon  and let on
it's your'n  and you turn back and fool along slow  so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to  and i'll go towards town a piece  and
take a fresh start  and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you 
and you needn't let on to know me at first  

i says 

 all right  but wait a minute   there's one more thing a thing that
nobody don't know but me   and that is  there's a nigger here that i'm
a-trying to steal out of slavery  and his name is jim old miss watson's
jim  

he says 

 what!  why  jim is  

he stopped and went to studying   i says 

 i know what you'll say   you'll say it's dirty  low-down business  but
what if it is   i'm low down  and i'm a-going to steal him  and i want
you keep mum and not let on   will you  

his eye lit up  and he says 

 i'll help you steal him! 

well  i let go all holts then  like i was shot   it was the most
astonishing speech i ever heard and i'm bound to say tom sawyer fell
considerable in my estimation   only i couldn't believe it   tom sawyer a
nigger-stealer!

 oh  shucks!   i says   you're joking  

 i ain't joking  either  

 well  then   i says   joking or no joking  if you hear anything said
about a runaway nigger  don't forget to remember that you don't know
nothing about him  and i don't know nothing about him  

then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon  and he drove off his way
and i drove mine   but of course i forgot all about driving slow on
accounts of being glad and full of thinking  so i got home a heap too
quick for that length of a trip   the old gentleman was at the door  and
he says 

 why  this is wonderful!  whoever would a thought it was in that mare to
do it   i wish we'd a timed her   and she hain't sweated a hair not a
hair  it's wonderful   why  i wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that
horse now i wouldn't  honest  and yet i'd a sold her for fifteen
before  and thought 'twas all she was worth  

that's all he said   he was the innocentest  best old soul i ever see 
but it warn't surprising  because he warn't only just a farmer  he was a
preacher  too  and had a little one-horse log church down back of the
plantation  which he built it himself at his own expense  for a church
and schoolhouse  and never charged nothing for his preaching  and it was
worth it  too   there was plenty other farmer-preachers like that  and
done the same way  down south 

in about half an hour tom's wagon drove up to the front stile  and aunt
sally she see it through the window  because it was only about fifty
yards  and says 

 why  there's somebody come!  i wonder who 'tis   why  i do believe it's
a stranger   jimmy  (that's one of the children)  run and tell lize to
put on another plate for dinner  

everybody made a rush for the front door  because  of course  a stranger
don't come every year  and so he lays over the yaller-fever  for
interest  when he does come   tom was over the stile and starting for the
house  the wagon was spinning up the road for the village  and we was all
bunched in the front door   tom had his store clothes on  and an
audience and that was always nuts for tom sawyer   in them circumstances
it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable   he warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep  no 
he come ca'm and important  like the ram   when he got a-front of us he
lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty  like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them  and
says 

 mr  archibald nichols  i presume  

 no  my boy   says the old gentleman   i'm sorry to say 't your driver
has deceived you  nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more 
come in  come in  

tom he took a look back over his shoulder  and says   too late he's out
of sight  

 yes  he's gone  my son  and you must come in and eat your dinner with
us  and then we'll hitch up and take you down to nichols's  

 oh  i can't make you so much trouble  i couldn't think of it   i'll walk
 i don't mind the distance  

 but we won't let you walk it wouldn't be southern hospitality to do it 
come right in  

 oh  do   says aunt sally   it ain't a bit of trouble to us  not a bit in
the world   you must stay   it's a long  dusty three mile  and we can't
let you walk   and  besides  i've already told 'em to put on another
plate when i see you coming  so you mustn't disappoint us   come right in
and make yourself at home  

so tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome  and let himself be
persuaded  and come in  and when he was in he said he was a stranger from
hicksville  ohio  and his name was william thompson and he made another
bow 

well  he run on  and on  and on  making up stuff about hicksville and
everybody in it he could invent  and i getting a little nervious  and
wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape  and at last 
still talking along  he reached over and kissed aunt sally right on the
mouth  and then settled back again in his chair comfortable  and was
going on talking  but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her
hand  and says 

 you owdacious puppy! 

he looked kind of hurt  and says 

 i'm surprised at you  m'am  

 you're s'rp why  what do you reckon i am   i've a good notion to take
and say  what do you mean by kissing me  

he looked kind of humble  and says 

 i didn't mean nothing  m'am   i didn't mean no harm   i i thought
you'd like it  

 why  you born fool!   she took up the spinning stick  and it looked like
it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it    what
made you think i'd like it  

 well  i don't know   only  they they told me you would  

 they told you i would   whoever told you's another lunatic   i never
heard the beat of it   who's they  

 why  everybody   they all said so  m'am  

it was all she could do to hold in  and her eyes snapped  and her fingers
worked like she wanted to scratch him  and she says 

 who's 'everybody'   out with their names  or ther'll be an idiot short  

he got up and looked distressed  and fumbled his hat  and says 

 i'm sorry  and i warn't expecting it   they told me to   they all told
me to   they all said  kiss her  and said she'd like it   they all said
it every one of them   but i'm sorry  m'am  and i won't do it no more
 i won't  honest  

 you won't  won't you   well  i sh'd reckon you won't! 

 no'm  i'm honest about it  i won't ever do it again till you ask me  

 till i ask you!  well  i never see the beat of it in my born days!  i
lay you'll be the methusalem-numskull of creation before ever i ask you
 or the likes of you  

 well   he says   it does surprise me so   i can't make it out  somehow 
they said you would  and i thought you would   but   he stopped and
looked around slow  like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
somewheres  and fetched up on the old gentleman's  and says   didn't you
think she'd like me to kiss her  sir  

 why  no  i i well  no  i b'lieve i didn't  

then he looks on around the same way to me  and says 

 tom  didn't you think aunt sally 'd open out her arms and say  'sid
sawyer ' 

 my land!  she says  breaking in and jumping for him   you impudent young
rascal  to fool a body so   and was going to hug him  but he fended her
off  and says 

 no  not till you've asked me first  

so she didn't lose no time  but asked him  and hugged him and kissed him
over and over again  and then turned him over to the old man  and he took
what was left   and after they got a little quiet again she says 

 why  dear me  i never see such a surprise   we warn't looking for you at
all  but only tom   sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him  

 it's because it warn't intended for any of us to come but tom   he says 
 but i begged and begged  and at the last minute she let me come  too 
so  coming down the river  me and tom thought it would be a first-rate
surprise for him to come here to the house first  and for me to by and by
tag along and drop in  and let on to be a stranger   but it was a
mistake  aunt sally   this ain't no healthy place for a stranger to
come  

 no not impudent whelps  sid   you ought to had your jaws boxed  i
hain't been so put out since i don't know when   but i don't care  i
don't mind the terms i'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
have you here  well  to think of that performance!  i don't deny it  i
was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack  

we had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
kitchen  and there was things enough on that table for seven families
 and all hot  too  none of your flabby  tough meat that's laid in a
cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold
cannibal in the morning   uncle silas he asked a pretty long blessing
over it  but it was worth it  and it didn't cool it a bit  neither  the
way i've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times   there was a
considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon  and me and tom was on
the lookout all the time  but it warn't no use  they didn't happen to say
nothing about any runaway nigger  and we was afraid to try to work up to
it   but at supper  at night  one of the little boys says 

 pa  mayn't tom and sid and me go to the show  

 no   says the old man   i reckon there ain't going to be any  and you
couldn't go if there was  because the runaway nigger told burton and me
all about that scandalous show  and burton said he would tell the people 
so i reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this
time  

so there it was! but i couldn't help it   tom and me was to sleep in the
same room and bed  so  being tired  we bid good-night and went up to bed
right after supper  and clumb out of the window and down the
lightning-rod  and shoved for the town  for i didn't believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint  and so if i didn't hurry up
and give them one they'd get into trouble sure 

on the road tom he told me all about how it was reckoned i was murdered 
and how pap disappeared pretty soon  and didn't come back no more  and
what a stir there was when jim run away  and i told tom all about our
royal nonesuch rapscallions  and as much of the raft voyage as i had time
to  and as we struck into the town and up through the here comes a
raging rush of people with torches  and an awful whooping and yelling 
and banging tin pans and blowing horns  and we jumped to one side to let
them go by  and as they went by i see they had the king and the duke
astraddle of a rail that is  i knowed it was the king and the duke 
though they was all over tar and feathers  and didn't look like nothing
in the world that was human just looked like a couple of monstrous big
soldier-plumes   well  it made me sick to see it  and i was sorry for
them poor pitiful rascals  it seemed like i couldn't ever feel any
hardness against them any more in the world   it was a dreadful thing to
see   human beings can be awful cruel to one another 

we see we was too late couldn't do no good   we asked some stragglers
about it  and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent 
and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of
his cavortings on the stage  then somebody give a signal  and the house
rose up and went for them 

so we poked along back home  and i warn't feeling so brash as i was
before  but kind of ornery  and humble  and to blame  somehow though i
hadn't done nothing   but that's always the way  it don't make no
difference whether you do right or wrong  a person's conscience ain't got
no sense  and just goes for him anyway   if i had a yaller dog that
didn't know no more than a person's conscience does i would pison him 
it takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides  and yet
ain't no good  nohow   tom sawyer he says the same 




we stopped talking  and got to thinking   by and by tom says 

 looky here  huck  what fools we are to not think of it before!  i bet i
know where jim is  

 no!  where  

 in that hut down by the ash-hopper   why  looky here   when we was at
dinner  didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles  

 yes  

 what did you think the vittles was for  

 for a dog  

 so 'd i  well  it wasn't for a dog  

 why  

 because part of it was watermelon  

 so it was i noticed it   well  it does beat all that i never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon   it shows how a body can see and don't
see at the same time  

 well  the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in  and he locked it
again when he came out   he fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from table same key  i bet   watermelon shows man  lock shows prisoner 
and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation 
and where the people's all so kind and good   jim's the prisoner   all
right i'm glad we found it out detective fashion  i wouldn't give
shucks for any other way   now you work your mind  and study out a plan
to steal jim  and i will study out one  too  and we'll take the one we
like the best  

what a head for just a boy to have!  if i had tom sawyer's head i
wouldn't trade it off to be a duke  nor mate of a steamboat  nor clown in
a circus  nor nothing i can think of   i went to thinking out a plan  but
only just to be doing something  i knowed very well where the right plan
was going to come from   pretty soon tom says 

 ready  

 yes   i says 

 all right bring it out  

 my plan is this   i says    we can easy find out if it's jim in there 
then get up my canoe to-morrow night  and fetch my raft over from the
island   then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old man's britches after he goes to bed  and shove off down the river on
the raft with jim  hiding daytimes and running nights  the way me and jim
used to do before   wouldn't that plan work  

 work   why  cert'nly it would work  like rats a-fighting   but it's too
blame' simple  there ain't nothing to it   what's the good of a plan that
ain't no more trouble than that   it's as mild as goose-milk   why  huck 
it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory  

i never said nothing  because i warn't expecting nothing different  but i
knowed mighty well that whenever he got his plan ready it wouldn't have
none of them objections to it 

and it didn't   he told me what it was  and i see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style  and would make jim just as free a man as
mine would  and maybe get us all killed besides   so i was satisfied  and
said we would waltz in on it   i needn't tell what it was here  because i
knowed it wouldn't stay the way  it was   i knowed he would be changing
it around every which way as we went along  and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance   and that is what he done 

well  one thing was dead sure  and that was that tom sawyer was in
earnest  and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery 
that was the thing that was too many for me   here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up  and had a character to lose  and folks at
home that had characters  and he was bright and not leather-headed  and
knowing and not ignorant  and not mean  but kind  and yet here he was 
without any more pride  or rightness  or feeling  than to stoop to this
business  and make himself a shame  and his family a shame  before
everybody   i couldn't understand it no way at all   it was outrageous 
and i knowed i ought to just up and tell him so  and so be his true
friend  and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself 
and i did start to tell him  but he shut me up  and says 

 don't you reckon i know what i'm about   don't i generly know what i'm
about  

 yes  

 didn't i say i was going to help steal the nigger  

 yes  

 well  then  

that's all he said  and that's all i said   it warn't no use to say any
more  because when he said he'd do a thing  he always done it   but i
couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing  so i just let
it go  and never bothered no more about it   if he was bound to have it
so  i couldn't help it 

when we got home the house was all dark and still  so we went on down to
the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it   we went through the yard so
as to see what the hounds would do   they knowed us  and didn't make no
more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in
the night   when we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the
two sides  and on the side i warn't acquainted with which was the north
side we found a square window-hole  up tolerable high  with just one
stout board nailed across it   i says 

 here's the ticket   this hole's big enough for jim to get through if we
wrench off the board  

tom says 

 it's as simple as tit-tat-toe  three-in-a-row  and as easy as playing
hooky   i should hope we can find a way that's a little more complicated
than that  huck finn  

 well  then   i says   how 'll it do to saw him out  the way i done
before i was murdered that time  

 that's more like   he says    it's real mysterious  and troublesome  and
good   he says   but i bet we can find a way that's twice as long   there
ain't no hurry  le's keep on looking around  

betwixt the hut and the fence  on the back side  was a lean-to that
joined the hut at the eaves  and was made out of plank   it was as long
as the hut  but narrow only about six foot wide   the door to it was at
the south end  and was padlocked   tom he went to the soap-kettle and
searched around  and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with 
so he took it and prized out one of the staples   the chain fell down 
and we opened the door and went in  and shut it  and struck a match  and
see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection with
it  and there warn't no floor to the shed  nor nothing in it but some old
rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow   the
match went out  and so did we  and shoved in the staple again  and the
door was locked as good as ever  tom was joyful   he says 

 now we're all right   we'll dig him out   it 'll take about a week! 

then we started for the house  and i went in the back door you only have
to pull a buckskin latch-string  they don't fasten the doors but that
warn't romantical enough for tom sawyer  no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightning-rod   but after he got up half way about three
times  and missed fire and fell every time  and the last time most busted
his brains out  he thought he'd got to give it up  but after he was
rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck  and this time
he made the trip 

in the morning we was up at break of day  and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed jim if it was
jim that was being fed   the niggers was just getting through breakfast
and starting for the fields  and jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan
with bread and meat and things  and whilst the others was leaving  the
key come from the house 

this nigger had a good-natured  chuckle-headed face  and his wool was all
tied up in little bunches with thread   that was to keep witches off   he
said the witches was pestering him awful these nights  and making him see
all kinds of strange things  and hear all kinds of strange words and
noises  and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in his
life   he got so worked up  and got to running on so about his troubles 
he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do   so tom says 

 what's the vittles for   going to feed the dogs  

the nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face  like when you
heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle  and he says 

 yes  mars sid  a dog   cur'us dog  too   does you want to go en look at
'im  

 yes  

i hunched tom  and whispers 

 you going  right here in the daybreak   that warn't the plan  

 no  it warn't  but it's the plan now  

so  drat him  we went along  but i didn't like it much   when we got in
we couldn't hardly see anything  it was so dark  but jim was there  sure
enough  and could see us  and he sings out 

 why  huck!  en good lan'! ain' dat misto tom  

i just knowed how it would be  i just expected it   i didn't know nothing
to do  and if i had i couldn't a done it  because that nigger busted in
and says 

 why  de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen  

we could see pretty well now   tom he looked at the nigger  steady and
kind of wondering  and says 

 does who know us  

 why  dis-yer runaway nigger  

 i don't reckon he does  but what put that into your head  

 what put it dar   didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed you  

tom says  in a puzzled-up kind of way 

 well  that's mighty curious   who sung out  when did he sing out   what
did he sing out   and turns to me  perfectly ca'm  and says   did you
hear anybody sing out  

of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing  so i says 

 no  i ain't heard nobody say nothing  

then he turns to jim  and looks him over like he never see him before 
and says 

 did you sing out  

 no  sah   says jim   i hain't said nothing  sah  

 not a word  

 no  sah  i hain't said a word  

 did you ever see us before  

 no  sah  not as i knows on  

so tom turns to the nigger  which was looking wild and distressed  and
says  kind of severe 

 what do you reckon's the matter with you  anyway   what made you think
somebody sung out  

 oh  it's de dad-blame' witches  sah  en i wisht i was dead  i do   dey's
awluz at it  sah  en dey do mos' kill me  dey sk'yers me so   please to
don't tell nobody 'bout it sah  er ole mars silas he'll scole me  'kase
he say dey ain't no witches   i jis' wish to goodness he was heah now
 den what would he say!  i jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun'
it dis time   but it's awluz jis' so  people dat's sot  stays sot  dey
won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves  en when you fine it
out en tell um 'bout it  dey doan' b'lieve you  

tom give him a dime  and said we wouldn't tell nobody  and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with  and then looks at jim  and
says 

 i wonder if uncle silas is going to hang this nigger   if i was to catch
a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away  i wouldn't give him up 
i'd hang him    and whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the
dime and bite it to see if it was good  he whispers to jim and says 

 don't ever let on to know us   and if you hear any digging going on
nights  it's us  we're going to set you free  

jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it  then the nigger
come back  and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us
to  and he said he would  more particular if it was dark  because the
witches went for him mostly in the dark  and it was good to have folks
around then 




it would be most an hour yet till breakfast  so we left and struck down
into the woods  because tom said we got to have some light to see how to
dig by  and a lantern makes too much  and might get us into trouble  what
we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox-fire  and
just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place   we
fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds  and set down to rest  and tom
says  kind of dissatisfied 

 blame it  this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be 
and so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan   there
ain't no watchman to be drugged now there ought to be a watchman   there
ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to   and there's jim chained
by one leg  with a ten-foot chain  to the leg of his bed   why  all you
got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain   and uncle
silas he trusts everybody  sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger  and
don't send nobody to watch the nigger   jim could a got out of that
window-hole before this  only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel
with a ten-foot chain on his leg   why  drat it  huck  it's the stupidest
arrangement i ever see  you got to invent all the difficulties   well  we
can't help it  we got to do the best we can with the materials we've got 
anyhow  there's one thing there's more honor in getting him out
through a lot of difficulties and dangers  where there warn't one of them
furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them  and
you had to contrive them all out of your own head   now look at just that
one thing of the lantern   when you come down to the cold facts  we
simply got to let on that a lantern's resky   why  we could work with a
torchlight procession if we wanted to  i believe   now  whilst i think of
it  we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we
get  

 what do we want of a saw  

 what do we want of a saw   hain't we got to saw the leg of jim's bed
off  so as to get the chain loose  

 why  you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
off  

 well  if that ain't just like you  huck finn   you can get up the
infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing   why  hain't you ever read
any books at all  baron trenck  nor casanova  nor benvenuto chelleeny 
nor henri iv   nor none of them heroes   who ever heard of getting a
prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that   no  the way all the
best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two  and leave it just so 
and swallow the sawdust  so it can't be found  and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no
sign of it's being sawed  and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound 
then  the night you're ready  fetch the leg a kick  down she goes  slip
off your chain  and there you are   nothing to do but hitch your rope
ladder to the battlements  shin down it  break your leg in the moat
 because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short  you know and there's
your horses and your trusty vassles  and they scoop you up and fling you
across a saddle  and away you go to your native langudoc  or navarre  or
wherever it is  it's gaudy  huck   i wish there was a moat to this cabin 
if we get time  the night of the escape  we'll dig one  

i says 

 what do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under
the cabin  

but he never heard me   he had forgot me and everything else   he had his
chin in his hand  thinking   pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head 
then sighs again  and says 

 no  it wouldn't do there ain't necessity enough for it  

 for what    i says 

 why  to saw jim's leg off   he says 

 good land!   i says   why  there ain't no necessity for it   and what
would you want to saw his leg off for  anyway  

 well  some of the best authorities has done it   they couldn't get the
chain off  so they just cut their hand off and shoved   and a leg would
be better still   but we got to let that go   there ain't necessity
enough in this case  and  besides  jim's a nigger  and wouldn't
understand the reasons for it  and how it's the custom in europe  so
we'll let it go   but there's one thing he can have a rope ladder  we
can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough   and we
can send it to him in a pie  it's mostly done that way   and i've et
worse pies  

 why  tom sawyer  how you talk   i says   jim ain't got no use for a rope
ladder  

 he has got use for it   how you talk  you better say  you don't know
nothing about it   he's got to have a rope ladder  they all do  

 what in the nation can he do with it  

 do with it   he can hide it in his bed  can't he   that's what they all
do  and he's got to  too   huck  you don't ever seem to want to do
anything that's regular  you want to be starting something fresh all the
time  s'pose he don't do nothing with it  ain't it there in his bed  for
a clew  after he's gone  and don't you reckon they'll want clews   of
course they will   and you wouldn't leave them any   that would be a
pretty howdy-do  wouldn't it!  i never heard of such a thing  

 well   i says   if it's in the regulations  and he's got to have it  all
right  let him have it  because i don't wish to go back on no
regulations  but there's one thing  tom sawyer if we go to tearing up
our sheets to make jim a rope ladder  we're going to get into trouble
with aunt sally  just as sure as you're born   now  the way i look at it 
a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing  and don't waste nothing  and is
just as good to load up a pie with  and hide in a straw tick  as any rag
ladder you can start  and as for jim  he ain't had no experience  and so
he don't care what kind of a  

 oh  shucks  huck finn  if i was as ignorant as you i'd keep still
 that's what i'd do   who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a
hickry-bark ladder   why  it's perfectly ridiculous  

 well  all right  tom  fix it your own way  but if you'll take my advice 
you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline  

he said that would do   and that gave him another idea  and he says 

 borrow a shirt  too  

 what do we want of a shirt  tom  

 want it for jim to keep a journal on  

 journal your granny jim can't write  

 s'pose he can't write he can make marks on the shirt  can't he  if we
make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
barrel-hoop  

 why  tom  we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better
one  and quicker  too  

 prisoners don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens
out of  you muggins   they always make their pens out of the hardest 
toughest  troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
that they can get their hands on  and it takes them weeks and weeks and
months and months to file it out  too  because they've got to do it by
rubbing it on the wall   they wouldn't use a goose-quill if they had it 
it ain't regular  

 well  then  what'll we make him the ink out of  

 many makes it out of iron-rust and tears  but that's the common sort and
women  the best authorities uses their own blood   jim can do that  and
when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to
let the world know where he's captivated  he can write it on the bottom
of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window   the iron mask
always done that  and it's a blame' good way  too  

 jim ain't got no tin plates   they feed him in a pan  

 that ain't nothing  we can get him some  

 can't nobody read his plates  

 that ain't got anything to do with it  huck finn   all he's got to do is
to write on the plate and throw it out   you don't have to be able to
read it  why  half the time you can't read anything a prisoner writes on
a tin plate  or anywhere else  

 well  then  what's the sense in wasting the plates  

 why  blame it all  it ain't the prisoner's plates  

 but it's somebody's plates  ain't it  

 well  spos'n it is   what does the prisoner care whose  

he broke off there  because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing   so we
cleared out for the house 

along during the morning i borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothes-line  and i found an old sack and put them in it  and we went
down and got the fox-fire  and put that in too   i called it borrowing 
because that was what pap always called it  but tom said it warn't
borrowing  it was stealing   he said we was representing prisoners  and
prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it  and nobody
don't blame them for it  either   it ain't no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with  tom said  it's his right  and
so  as long as we was representing a prisoner  we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with   he said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very
different thing  and nobody but a mean  ornery person would steal when he
warn't a prisoner   so we allowed we would steal everything there was
that come handy   and yet he made a mighty fuss  one day  after that 
when i stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it  and he made
me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for 
tom said that what he meant was  we could steal anything we needed  well 
i says  i needed the watermelon   but he said i didn't need it to get out
of prison with  there's where the difference was   he said if i'd a
wanted it to hide a knife in  and smuggle it to jim to kill the seneskal
with  it would a been all right   so i let it go at that  though i
couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if i got to set
down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time i
see a chance to hog a watermelon 

well  as i was saying  we waited that morning till everybody was settled
down to business  and nobody in sight around the yard  then tom he
carried the sack into the lean-to whilst i stood off a piece to keep
watch   by and by he come out  and we went and set down on the woodpile
to talk   he says 

 everything's all right now except tools  and that's easy fixed  

 tools    i says 

 yes  

 tools for what  

 why  to dig with   we ain't a-going to gnaw him out  are we  

 ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
nigger out with    i says 

he turns on me  looking pitying enough to make a body cry  and says 

 huck finn  did you ever hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels  and
all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with   now
i want to ask you if you got any reasonableness in you at all what kind
of a show would that give him to be a hero   why  they might as well lend
him the key and done with it   picks and shovels why  they wouldn't
furnish 'em to a king  

 well  then   i says   if we don't want the picks and shovels  what do we
want  

 a couple of case-knives  

 to dig the foundations out from under that cabin with  

 yes  

 confound it  it's foolish  tom  

 it don't make no difference how foolish it is  it's the right way and
it's the regular way   and there ain't no other way  that ever i heard
of  and i've read all the books that gives any information about these
things  they always dig out with a case-knife and not through dirt  mind
you  generly it's through solid rock   and it takes them weeks and weeks
and weeks  and for ever and ever   why  look at one of them prisoners in
the bottom dungeon of the castle deef  in the harbor of marseilles  that
dug himself out that way  how long was he at it  you reckon  

 i don't know  

 well  guess  

 i don't know   a month and a half  

 thirty-seven year and he come out in china   that's the kind   i wish
the bottom of this fortress was solid rock  

 jim don't know nobody in china  

 what's that got to do with it   neither did that other fellow   but
you're always a-wandering off on a side issue   why can't you stick to
the main point  

 all right i don't care where he comes out  so he comes out  and jim
don't  either  i reckon   but there's one thing  anyway jim's too old to
be dug out with a case-knife   he won't last  

 yes he will last  too   you don't reckon it's going to take thirty-seven
years to dig out through a dirt foundation  do you  

 how long will it take  tom  

 well  we can't resk being as long as we ought to  because it mayn't take
very long for uncle silas to hear from down there by new orleans   he'll
hear jim ain't from there   then his next move will be to advertise jim 
or something like that   so we can't resk being as long digging him out
as we ought to   by rights i reckon we ought to be a couple of years  but
we can't   things being so uncertain  what i recommend is this   that we
really dig right in  as quick as we can  and after that  we can let on 
to ourselves  that we was at it thirty-seven years   then we can snatch
him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm   yes  i reckon
that 'll be the best way  

 now  there's sense in that   i says    letting on don't cost nothing 
letting on ain't no trouble  and if it's any object  i don't mind letting
on we was at it a hundred and fifty year   it wouldn't strain me none 
after i got my hand in   so i'll mosey along now  and smouch a couple of
case-knives  

 smouch three   he says   we want one to make a saw out of  

 tom  if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it   i says 
 there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the
weather-boarding behind the smoke-house  

he looked kind of weary and discouraged-like  and says 

 it ain't no use to try to learn you nothing  huck   run along and smouch
the knives three of them    so i done it 




as soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
lightning-rod  and shut ourselves up in the lean-to  and got out our pile
of fox-fire  and went to work   we cleared everything out of the way 
about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log   tom said we
was right behind jim's bed now  and we'd dig in under it  and when we got
through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole
there  because jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground  and you'd
have to raise it up and look under to see the hole   so we dug and dug
with the case-knives till most midnight  and then we was dog-tired  and
our hands was blistered  and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything
hardly   at last i says 

 this ain't no thirty-seven year job  this is a thirty-eight year job 
tom sawyer  

he never said nothing   but he sighed  and pretty soon he stopped
digging  and then for a good little while i knowed that he was thinking 
then he says 

 it ain't no use  huck  it ain't a-going to work   if we was prisoners it
would  because then we'd have as many years as we wanted  and no hurry 
and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig  every day  while they was
changing watches  and so our hands wouldn't get blistered  and we could
keep it up right along  year in and year out  and do it right  and the
way it ought to be done   but we can't fool along  we got to rush  we
ain't got no time to spare   if we was to put in another night this way
we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well couldn't
touch a case-knife with them sooner  

 well  then  what we going to do  tom  

 i'll tell you   it ain't right  and it ain't moral  and i wouldn't like
it to get out  but there ain't only just the one way   we got to dig him
out with the picks  and let on it's case-knives  

 now you're talking!   i says   your head gets leveler and leveler all
the time  tom sawyer   i says    picks is the thing  moral or no moral 
and as for me  i don't care shucks for the morality of it  nohow   when i
start in to steal a nigger  or a watermelon  or a sunday-school book  i
ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done   what i want is my
nigger  or what i want is my watermelon  or what i want is my
sunday-school book  and if a pick's the handiest thing  that's the thing
i'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that sunday-school
book out with  and i don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
about it nuther  

 well   he says   there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like
this  if it warn't so  i wouldn't approve of it  nor i wouldn't stand by
and see the rules broke because right is right  and wrong is wrong  and
a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows
better   it might answer for you to dig jim out with a pick  without any
letting on  because you don't know no better  but it wouldn't for me 
because i do know better   gimme a case-knife  

he had his own by him  but i handed him mine   he flung it down  and
says 

 gimme a case-knife  

i didn't know just what to do but then i thought   i scratched around
amongst the old tools  and got a pickaxe and give it to him  and he took
it and went to work  and never said a word 

he was always just that particular   full of principle 

so then i got a shovel  and then we picked and shoveled  turn about  and
made the fur fly   we stuck to it about a half an hour  which was as long
as we could stand up  but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it 
when i got up stairs i looked out at the window and see tom doing his
level best with the lightning-rod  but he couldn't come it  his hands was
so sore   at last he says 

 it ain't no use  it can't be done   what you reckon i better do   can't
you think of no way  

 yes   i says   but i reckon it ain't regular   come up the stairs  and
let on it's a lightning-rod  

so he done it 

next day tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house 
for to make some pens for jim out of  and six tallow candles  and i hung
around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance  and stole three tin
plates   tom says it wasn't enough  but i said nobody wouldn't ever see
the plates that jim throwed out  because they'd fall in the dog-fennel
and jimpson weeds under the window-hole then we could tote them back and
he could use them over again   so tom was satisfied   then he says 

 now  the thing to study out is  how to get the things to jim  

 take them in through the hole   i says   when we get it done  

he only just looked scornful  and said something about nobody ever heard
of such an idiotic idea  and then he went to studying   by and by he said
he had ciphered out two or three ways  but there warn't no need to decide
on any of them yet   said we'd got to post jim first 

that night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten  and took
one of the candles along  and listened under the window-hole  and heard
jim snoring  so we pitched it in  and it didn't wake him   then we
whirled in with the pick and shovel  and in about two hours and a half
the job was done   we crept in under jim's bed and into the cabin  and
pawed around and found the candle and lit it  and stood over jim awhile 
and found him looking hearty and healthy  and then we woke him up gentle
and gradual   he was so glad to see us he most cried  and called us
honey  and all the pet names he could think of  and was for having us
hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away 
and clearing out without losing any time   but tom he showed him how
unregular it would be  and set down and told him all about our plans  and
how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm  and not
to be the least afraid  because we would see he got away  sure   so jim
he said it was all right  and we set there and talked over old times
awhile  and then tom asked a lot of questions  and when jim told him
uncle silas come in every day or two to pray with him  and aunt sally
come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat  and both of
them was kind as they could be  tom says 

 now i know how to fix it   we'll send you some things by them  

i said   don't do nothing of the kind  it's one of the most jackass ideas
i ever struck   but he never paid no attention to me  went right on   it
was his way when he'd got his plans set 

so he told jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other
large things by nat  the nigger that fed him  and he must be on the
lookout  and not be surprised  and not let nat see him open them  and we
would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them
out  and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her
apron-pocket  if we got a chance  and told him what they would be and
what they was for   and told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
his blood  and all that  he told him everything   jim he couldn't see no
sense in the most of it  but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
better than him  so he was satisfied  and said he would do it all just as
tom said 

jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco  so we had a right down good
sociable time  then we crawled out through the hole  and so home to bed 
with hands that looked like they'd been chawed   tom was in high spirits 
he said it was the best fun he ever had in his life  and the most
intellectural  and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep
it up all the rest of our lives and leave jim to our children to get out 
for he believed jim would come to like it better and better the more he
got used to it   he said that in that way it could be strung out to as
much as eighty year  and would be the best time on record   and he said
it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it 

in the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
candlestick into handy sizes  and tom put them and the pewter spoon in
his pocket   then we went to the nigger cabins  and while i got nat's
notice off  tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
corn-pone that was in jim's pan  and we went along with nat to see how it
would work  and it just worked noble  when jim bit into it it most mashed
all his teeth out  and there warn't ever anything could a worked better 
tom said so himself  jim he never let on but what it was only just a
piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread 
you know  but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his
fork into it in three or four places first 

and whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light  here comes a
couple of the hounds bulging in from under jim's bed  and they kept on
piling in till there was eleven of them  and there warn't hardly room in
there to get your breath   by jings  we forgot to fasten that lean-to
door!  the nigger nat he only just hollered  witches  once  and keeled
over on to the floor amongst the dogs  and begun to groan like he was
dying   tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of jim's meat  and
the dogs went for it  and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door  and i knowed he'd fixed the other door too 
then he went to work on the nigger  coaxing him and petting him  and
asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again   he raised up 
and blinked his eyes around  and says 

 mars sid  you'll say i's a fool  but if i didn't b'lieve i see most a
million dogs  er devils  er some'n  i wisht i may die right heah in dese
tracks   i did  mos' sholy   mars sid  i felt um i felt um  sah  dey was
all over me   dad fetch it  i jis' wisht i could git my han's on one er
dem witches jis' wunst on'y jis' wunst it's all i'd ast   but mos'ly i
wisht dey'd lemme 'lone  i does  

tom says 

 well  i tell you what i think   what makes them come here just at this
runaway nigger's breakfast-time   it's because they're hungry  that's the
reason   you make them a witch pie  that's the thing for you to do  

 but my lan'  mars sid  how's i gwyne to make 'm a witch pie   i doan'
know how to make it   i hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'  

 well  then  i'll have to make it myself  

 will you do it  honey  will you   i'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot 
i will! 

 all right  i'll do it  seeing it's you  and you've been good to us and
showed us the runaway nigger   but you got to be mighty careful   when we
come around  you turn your back  and then whatever we've put in the pan 
don't you let on you see it at all   and don't you look when jim unloads
the pan something might happen  i don't know what   and above all  don't
you handle the witch-things  

 hannel 'm  mars sid   what is you a-talkin' 'bout   i wouldn' lay de
weight er my finger on um  not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars  i
wouldn't  




that was all fixed   so then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in
the back yard  where they keep the old boots  and rags  and pieces of
bottles  and wore-out tin things  and all such truck  and scratched
around and found an old tin washpan  and stopped up the holes as well as
we could  to bake the pie in  and took it down cellar and stole it full
of flour and started for breakfast  and found a couple of shingle-nails
that tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
sorrows on the dungeon walls with  and dropped one of them in aunt
sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair  and t'other we stuck
in the band of uncle silas's hat  which was on the bureau  because we
heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's
house this morning  and then went to breakfast  and tom dropped the
pewter spoon in uncle silas's coat-pocket  and aunt sally wasn't come
yet  so we had to wait a little while 

and when she come she was hot and red and cross  and couldn't hardly wait
for the blessing  and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand
and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other 
and says 

 i've hunted high and i've hunted low  and it does beat all what has
become of your other shirt  

my heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things  and a hard
piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the
road with a cough  and was shot across the table  and took one of the
children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm  and let a cry
out of him the size of a warwhoop  and tom he turned kinder blue around
the gills  and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
about a quarter of a minute or as much as that  and i would a sold out
for half price if there was a bidder   but after that we was all right
again it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold 
uncle silas he says 

 it's most uncommon curious  i can't understand it   i know perfectly
well i took it off  because  

 because you hain't got but one on   just listen at the man!  i know you
took it off  and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory 
too  because it was on the clo's-line yesterday i see it there myself 
but it's gone  that's the long and the short of it  and you'll just have
to change to a red flann'l one till i can get time to make a new one 
and it 'll be the third i've made in two years   it just keeps a body on
the jump to keep you in shirts  and whatever you do manage to do with 'm
all is more'n i can make out   a body 'd think you would learn to take
some sort of care of 'em at your time of life  

 i know it  sally  and i do try all i can   but it oughtn't to be
altogether my fault  because  you know  i don't see them nor have nothing
to do with them except when they're on me  and i don't believe i've ever
lost one of them off of me  

 well  it ain't your fault if you haven't  silas  you'd a done it if you
could  i reckon   and the shirt ain't all that's gone  nuther   ther's a
spoon gone  and that ain't all   there was ten  and now ther's only nine 
the calf got the shirt  i reckon  but the calf never took the spoon 
that's certain  

 why  what else is gone  sally  

 ther's six candles gone that's what   the rats could a got the candles 
and i reckon they did  i wonder they don't walk off with the whole place 
the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do it  and if
they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair  silas you'd never find it
out  but you can't lay the spoon on the rats  and that i know  

 well  sally  i'm in fault  and i acknowledge it  i've been remiss  but i
won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes  

 oh  i wouldn't hurry  next year 'll do   matilda angelina araminta
phelps! 

whack comes the thimble  and the child snatches her claws out of the
sugar-bowl without fooling around any   just then the nigger woman steps
on to the passage  and says 

 missus  dey's a sheet gone  

 a sheet gone!  well  for the land's sake! 

 i'll stop up them holes to-day   says uncle silas  looking sorrowful 

 oh  do shet up! s'pose the rats took the sheet   where's it gone 
lize  

 clah to goodness i hain't no notion  miss' sally   she wuz on de
clo'sline yistiddy  but she done gone   she ain' dah no mo' now  

 i reckon the world is coming to an end   i never see the beat of it in
all my born days   a shirt  and a sheet  and a spoon  and six can  

 missus   comes a young yaller wench   dey's a brass cannelstick miss'n  

 cler out from here  you hussy  er i'll take a skillet to ye! 

well  she was just a-biling   i begun to lay for a chance  i reckoned i
would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated   she
kept a-raging right along  running her insurrection all by herself  and
everybody else mighty meek and quiet  and at last uncle silas  looking
kind of foolish  fishes up that spoon out of his pocket   she stopped 
with her mouth open and her hands up  and as for me  i wished i was in
jeruslem or somewheres  but not long  because she says 

 it's just as i expected   so you had it in your pocket all the time  and
like as not you've got the other things there  too   how'd it get there  

 i reely don't know  sally   he says  kind of apologizing   or you know i
would tell   i was a-studying over my text in acts seventeen before
breakfast  and i reckon i put it in there  not noticing  meaning to put
my testament in  and it must be so  because my testament ain't in  but
i'll go and see  and if the testament is where i had it  i'll know i
didn't put it in  and that will show that i laid the testament down and
took up the spoon  and  

 oh  for the land's sake!  give a body a rest!  go 'long now  the whole
kit and biling of ye  and don't come nigh me again till i've got back my
peace of mind  

i'd a heard her if she'd a said it to herself  let alone speaking it out 
and i'd a got up and obeyed her if i'd a been dead   as we was passing
through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat  and the
shingle-nail fell out on the floor  and he just merely picked it up and
laid it on the mantel-shelf  and never said nothing  and went out   tom
see him do it  and remembered about the spoon  and says 

 well  it ain't no use to send things by him no more  he ain't reliable  
then he says    but he done us a good turn with the spoon  anyway 
without knowing it  and so we'll go and do him one without him knowing
it stop up his rat-holes  

there was a noble good lot of them down cellar  and it took us a whole
hour  but we done the job tight and good and shipshape   then we heard
steps on the stairs  and blowed out our light and hid  and here comes the
old man  with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other 
looking as absent-minded as year before last   he went a mooning around 
first to one rat-hole and then another  till he'd been to them all   then
he stood about five minutes  picking tallow-drip off of his candle and
thinking   then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs  saying 

 well  for the life of me i can't remember when i done it   i could show
her now that i warn't to blame on account of the rats   but never mind
 let it go   i reckon it wouldn't do no good  

and so he went on a-mumbling up stairs  and then we left   he was a
mighty nice old man   and always is 

tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon  but he said
we'd got to have it  so he took a think   when he had ciphered it out he
told me how we was to do  then we went and waited around the spoon-basket
till we see aunt sally coming  and then tom went to counting the spoons
and laying them out to one side  and i slid one of them up my sleeve  and
tom says 

 why  aunt sally  there ain't but nine spoons yet  

she says 

 go 'long to your play  and don't bother me   i know better  i counted 'm
myself  

 well  i've counted them twice  aunty  and i can't make but nine  

she looked out of all patience  but of course she come to count anybody
would 

 i declare to gracious ther' ain't but nine!  she says    why  what in
the world plague take the things  i'll count 'm again  

so i slipped back the one i had  and when she got done counting  she
says 

 hang the troublesome rubbage  ther's ten now!  and she looked huffy and
bothered both   but tom says 

 why  aunty  i don't think there's ten  

 you numskull  didn't you see me count 'm  

 i know  but  

 well  i'll count 'm again  

so i smouched one  and they come out nine  same as the other time   well 
she was in a tearing way just a-trembling all over  she was so mad   but
she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to count in
the basket for a spoon sometimes  and so  three times they come out
right  and three times they come out wrong   then she grabbed up the
basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west 
and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace  and if we come
bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us   so we
had the odd spoon  and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was
a-giving us our sailing orders  and jim got it all right  along with her
shingle nail  before noon   we was very well satisfied with this
business  and tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took  because
he said now she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save
her life  and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she did  and
said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three days
he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to
ever count them any more 

so we put the sheet back on the line that night  and stole one out of her
closet  and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of
days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more  and she
didn't care  and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out
about it  and wouldn't count them again not to save her life  she druther
die first 

so we was all right now  as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
the candles  by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up
counting  and as to the candlestick  it warn't no consequence  it would
blow over by and by 

but that pie was a job  we had no end of trouble with that pie   we fixed
it up away down in the woods  and cooked it there  and we got it done at
last  and very satisfactory  too  but not all in one day  and we had to
use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through  and we got
burnt pretty much all over  in places  and eyes put out with the smoke 
because  you see  we didn't want nothing but a crust  and we couldn't
prop it up right  and she would always cave in   but of course we thought
of the right way at last which was to cook the ladder  too  in the
pie   so then we laid in with jim the second night  and tore up the sheet
all in little strings and twisted them together  and long before daylight
we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with   we let on it
took nine months to make it 

and in the forenoon we took it down to the woods  but it wouldn't go into
the pie   being made of a whole sheet  that way  there was rope enough
for forty pies if we'd a wanted them  and plenty left over for soup  or
sausage  or anything you choose   we could a had a whole dinner 

but we didn't need it   all we needed was just enough for the pie 
and so we throwed the rest away   we didn't cook none of the pies in the
wash-pan afraid the solder would melt  but uncle silas he had a noble
brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of  because it belonged
to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
england with william the conqueror in the mayflower or one of them early
ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
that was valuable  not on account of being any account  because they
warn't  but on account of them being relicts  you know  and we snaked her
out  private  and took her down there  but she failed on the first pies 
because we didn't know how  but she come up smiling on the last one   we
took and lined her with dough  and set her in the coals  and loaded her
up with rag rope  and put on a dough roof  and shut down the lid  and put
hot embers on top  and stood off five foot  with the long handle  cool
and comfortable  and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a
satisfaction to look at  but the person that et it would want to fetch a
couple of kags of toothpicks along  for if that rope ladder wouldn't
cramp him down to business i don't know nothing what i'm talking about 
and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time  too 

nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in jim's pan  and we put the
three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles  and so jim
got everything all right  and as soon as he was by himself he busted into
the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick  and scratched
some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole 




making them pens was a distressid tough job  and so was the saw  and jim
allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all   that's the
one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall   but he had to have
it  tom said he'd got to  there warn't no case of a state prisoner not
scrabbling his inscription to leave behind  and his coat of arms 

 look at lady jane grey   he says   look at gilford dudley  look at old
northumberland!  why  huck  s'pose it is considerble trouble  what you
going to do  how you going to get around it   jim's got to do his
inscription and coat of arms   they all do  

jim says 

 why  mars tom  i hain't got no coat o' arm  i hain't got nuffn but dish
yer ole shirt  en you knows i got to keep de journal on dat  

 oh  you don't understand  jim  a coat of arms is very different  

 well   i says   jim's right  anyway  when he says he ain't got no coat
of arms  because he hain't  

 i reckon i knowed that   tom says   but you bet he'll have one before he
goes out of this because he's going out right  and there ain't going to
be no flaws in his record  

so whilst me and jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece  jim
a-making his'n out of the brass and i making mine out of the spoon  tom
set to work to think out the coat of arms   by and by he said he'd struck
so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take  but there was one
which he reckoned he'd decide on   he says 

 on the scutcheon we'll have a bend or in the dexter base  a saltire
murrey in the fess  with a dog  couchant  for common charge  and under
his foot a chain embattled  for slavery  with a chevron vert in a chief
engrailed  and three invected lines on a field azure  with the nombril
points rampant on a dancette indented  crest  a runaway nigger  sable 
with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister  and a couple of
gules for supporters  which is you and me  motto  maggiore fretta  minore
otto   got it out of a book means the more haste the less speed  

 geewhillikins   i says   but what does the rest of it mean  

 we ain't got no time to bother over that   he says   we got to dig in
like all git-out  

 well  anyway   i says   what's some of it   what's a fess  

 a fess a fess is you don't need to know what a fess is   i'll show him
how to make it when he gets to it  

 shucks  tom   i says   i think you might tell a person   what's a bar
sinister  

 oh  i don't know   but he's got to have it   all the nobility does  

that was just his way   if it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you 
he wouldn't do it   you might pump at him a week  it wouldn't make no
difference 

he'd got all that coat of arms business fixed  so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work  which was to plan out a
mournful inscription said jim got to have one  like they all done   he
made up a lot  and wrote them out on a paper  and read them off  so 

1   here a captive heart busted  2   here a poor prisoner  forsook by the
world and friends  fretted his sorrowful life  3   here a lonely heart
broke  and a worn spirit went to its rest  after thirty-seven years of
solitary captivity  4   here  homeless and friendless  after thirty-seven
years of bitter captivity  perished a noble stranger  natural son of
louis xiv 

tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them  and he most broke down 
when he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for jim to
scrabble on to the wall  they was all so good  but at last he allowed he
would let him scrabble them all on   jim said it would take him a year to
scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail  and he didn't
know how to make letters  besides  but tom said he would block them out
for him  and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the
lines   then pretty soon he says 

 come to think  the logs ain't a-going to do  they don't have log walls
in a dungeon   we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock   we'll fetch a
rock  

jim said the rock was worse than the logs  he said it would take him such
a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out   but
tom said he would let me help him do it   then he took a look to see how
me and jim was getting along with the pens   it was most pesky tedious
hard work and slow  and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the
sores  and we didn't seem to make no headway  hardly  so tom says 

 i know how to fix it   we got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
mournful inscriptions  and we can kill two birds with that same rock 
there's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill  and we'll smouch it  and
carve the things on it  and file out the pens and the saw on it  too  

it warn't no slouch of an idea  and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone
nuther  but we allowed we'd tackle it   it warn't quite midnight yet  so
we cleared out for the mill  leaving jim at work   we smouched the
grindstone  and set out to roll her home  but it was a most nation tough
job  sometimes  do what we could  we couldn't keep her from falling over 
and she come mighty near mashing us every time   tom said she was going
to get one of us  sure  before we got through   we got her half way  and
then we was plumb played out  and most drownded with sweat   we see it
warn't no use  we got to go and fetch jim so he raised up his bed and
slid the chain off of the bed-leg  and wrapt it round and round his neck 
and we crawled out through our hole and down there  and jim and me laid
into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing  and tom
superintended   he could out-superintend any boy i ever see   he knowed
how to do everything 

our hole was pretty big  but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone
through  but jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough   then tom
marked out them things on it with the nail  and set jim to work on them 
with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
lean-to for a hammer  and told him to work till the rest of his candle
quit on him  and then he could go to bed  and hide the grindstone under
his straw tick and sleep on it   then we helped him fix his chain back on
the bed-leg  and was ready for bed ourselves   but tom thought of
something  and says 

 you got any spiders in here  jim  

 no  sah  thanks to goodness i hain't  mars tom  

 all right  we'll get you some  

 but bless you  honey  i doan' want none   i's afeard un um   i jis' 's
soon have rattlesnakes aroun'  

tom thought a minute or two  and says 

 it's a good idea   and i reckon it's been done   it must a been done  it
stands to reason   yes  it's a prime good idea   where could you keep
it  

 keep what  mars tom  

 why  a rattlesnake  

 de goodness gracious alive  mars tom!  why  if dey was a rattlesnake to
come in heah i'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall  i would  wid
my head  

why  jim  you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little   you could tame
it  

 tame it! 

 yes easy enough   every animal is grateful for kindness and petting 
and they wouldn't think of hurting a person that pets them   any book
will tell you that   you try that's all i ask  just try for two or three
days  why  you can get him so in a little while that he'll love you  and
sleep with you  and won't stay away from you a minute  and will let you
wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth  

 please  mars tom doan' talk so!  i can't stan' it!  he'd let me shove
his head in my mouf fer a favor  hain't it   i lay he'd wait a pow'ful
long time 'fo' i ast him   en mo' en dat  i doan' want him to sleep wid
me  

 jim  don't act so foolish   a prisoner's got to have some kind of a dumb
pet  and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried  why  there's more glory
to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way
you could ever think of to save your life  

 why  mars tom  i doan' want no sich glory   snake take 'n bite jim's
chin off  den whah is de glory   no  sah  i doan' want no sich doin's  

 blame it  can't you try   i only want you to try you needn't keep it up
if it don't work  

 but de trouble all done ef de snake bite me while i's a tryin' him 
mars tom  i's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable  but
ef you en huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame  i's gwyne to
leave  dat's shore  

 well  then  let it go  let it go  if you're so bull-headed about it   we
can get you some garter-snakes  and you can tie some buttons on their
tails  and let on they're rattlesnakes  and i reckon that 'll have to
do  

 i k'n stan' dem  mars tom  but blame' 'f i couldn' get along widout um 
i tell you dat   i never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble
to be a prisoner  

 well  it always is when it's done right   you got any rats around here  

 no  sah  i hain't seed none  

 well  we'll get you some rats  

 why  mars tom  i doan' want no rats   dey's de dadblamedest creturs to
'sturb a body  en rustle roun' over 'im  en bite his feet  when he's
tryin' to sleep  i ever see   no  sah  gimme g'yarter-snakes  'f i's got
to have 'm  but doan' gimme no rats  i hain' got no use f'r um  skasely  

 but  jim  you got to have 'em they all do   so don't make no more fuss
about it   prisoners ain't ever without rats   there ain't no instance of
it   and they train them  and pet them  and learn them tricks  and they
get to be as sociable as flies   but you got to play music to them   you
got anything to play music on  

 i ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper  en a juice-harp 
but i reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp  

 yes they would   they don't care what kind of music 'tis   a jews-harp's
plenty good enough for a rat   all animals like music in a prison they
dote on it   specially  painful music  and you can't get no other kind
out of a jews-harp   it always interests them  they come out to see
what's the matter with you   yes  you're all right  you're fixed very
well   you want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep  and
early in the mornings  and play your jews-harp  play 'the last link is
broken' that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else 
and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats  and the
snakes  and spiders  and things begin to feel worried about you  and
come   and they'll just fairly swarm over you  and have a noble good
time  

 yes  dey will  i reck'n  mars tom  but what kine er time is jim havin' 
blest if i kin see de pint   but i'll do it ef i got to   i reck'n i
better keep de animals satisfied  en not have no trouble in de house  

tom waited to think it over  and see if there wasn't nothing else  and
pretty soon he says 

 oh  there's one thing i forgot   could you raise a flower here  do you
reckon  

 i doan know but maybe i could  mars tom  but it's tolable dark in heah 
en i ain' got no use f'r no flower  nohow  en she'd be a pow'ful sight o'
trouble  

 well  you try it  anyway   some other prisoners has done it  

 one er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah  mars
tom  i reck'n  but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss  

 don't you believe it   we'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in
the corner over there  and raise it   and don't call it mullen  call it
pitchiola that's its right name when it's in a prison   and you want to
water it with your tears  

 why  i got plenty spring water  mars tom  

 you don't want spring water  you want to water it with your tears   it's
the way they always do  

 why  mars tom  i lay i kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid
spring water whiles another man's a start'n one wid tears  

 that ain't the idea   you got to do it with tears  

 she'll die on my han's  mars tom  she sholy will  kase i doan' skasely
ever cry  

so tom was stumped   but he studied it over  and then said jim would have
to worry along the best he could with an onion   he promised he would go
to the nigger cabins and drop one  private  in jim's coffee-pot  in the
morning  jim said he would  jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee  
and found so much fault with it  and with the work and bother of raising
the mullen  and jews-harping the rats  and petting and flattering up the
snakes and spiders and things  on top of all the other work he had to do
on pens  and inscriptions  and journals  and things  which made it more
trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he
ever undertook  that tom most lost all patience with him  and said he was
just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in
the world to make a name for himself  and yet he didn't know enough to
appreciate them  and they was just about wasted on him   so jim he was
sorry  and said he wouldn't behave so no more  and then me and tom shoved
for bed 




in the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and
fetched it down  and unstopped the best rat-hole  and in about an hour we
had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones  and then we took it and put it
in a safe place under aunt sally's bed   but while we was gone for
spiders little thomas franklin benjamin jefferson elexander phelps found
it there  and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out 
and they did  and aunt sally she come in  and when we got back she was
a-standing on top of the bed raising cain  and the rats was doing what
they could to keep off the dull times for her   so she took and dusted us
both with the hickry  and we was as much as two hours catching another
fifteen or sixteen  drat that meddlesome cub  and they warn't the
likeliest  nuther  because the first haul was the pick of the flock 
i never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was 

we got a splendid stock of sorted spiders  and bugs  and frogs  and
caterpillars  and one thing or another  and we like to got a hornet's
nest  but we didn't   the family was at home   we didn't give it right
up  but stayed with them as long as we could  because we allowed we'd
tire them out or they'd got to tire us out  and they done it   then we
got allycumpain and rubbed on the places  and was pretty near all right
again  but couldn't set down convenient   and so we went for the snakes 
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes  and put them in a
bag  and put it in our room  and by that time it was supper-time  and a
rattling good honest day's work   and hungry  oh  no  i reckon not!  and
there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back we didn't half
tie the sack  and they worked out somehow  and left   but it didn't
matter much  because they was still on the premises somewheres   so we
judged we could get some of them again   no  there warn't no real
scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell   you'd see
them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then  and they
generly landed in your plate  or down the back of your neck  and most of
the time where you didn't want them   well  they was handsome and
striped  and there warn't no harm in a million of them  but that never
made no difference to aunt sally  she despised snakes  be the breed what
they might  and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it  and
every time one of them flopped down on her  it didn't make no difference
what she was doing  she would just lay that work down and light out   i
never see such a woman   and you could hear her whoop to jericho   you
couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs   and if
she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
howl that you would think the house was afire   she disturbed the old man
so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes
created   why  after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week aunt sally warn't over it yet  she warn't
near over it  when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right
out of her stockings   it was very curious   but tom said all women was
just so   he said they was made that way for some reason or other 

we got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way  and she
allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them   i didn't mind the lickings  because
they didn't amount to nothing  but i minded the trouble we had to lay in
another lot   but we got them laid in  and all the other things  and you
never see a cabin as blithesome as jim's was when they'd all swarm out
for music and go for him   jim didn't like the spiders  and the spiders
didn't like jim  and so they'd lay for him  and make it mighty warm for
him   and he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone
there warn't no room in bed for him  skasely  and when there was  a body
couldn't sleep  it was so lively  and it was always lively  he said 
because they never all slept at one time  but took turn about  so when
the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck  and when the rats turned in
the snakes come on watch  so he always had one gang under him  in his
way  and t'other gang having a circus over him  and if he got up to hunt
a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over 
he said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner
again  not for a salary 

well  by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape   the
shirt was sent in early  in a pie  and every time a rat bit jim he would
get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh  the
pens was made  the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
grindstone  the bed-leg was sawed in two  and we had et up the sawdust 
and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache   we reckoned we was all going
to die  but didn't   it was the most undigestible sawdust i ever see  and
tom said the same   but as i was saying  we'd got all the work done now 
at last  and we was all pretty much fagged out  too  but mainly jim   the
old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below orleans to
come and get their runaway nigger  but hadn't got no answer  because
there warn't no such plantation  so he allowed he would advertise jim in
the st  louis and new orleans papers  and when he mentioned the st  louis
ones it give me the cold shivers  and i see we hadn't no time to lose 
so tom said  now for the nonnamous letters 

 what's them    i says 

 warnings to the people that something is up   sometimes it's done one
way  sometimes another   but there's always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle   when louis xvi  was going to
light out of the tooleries a servant-girl done it   it's a very good way 
and so is the nonnamous letters   we'll use them both   and it's usual
for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him  and she stays in 
and he slides out in her clothes   we'll do that  too  

 but looky here  tom  what do we want to warn anybody for that
something's up   let them find it out for themselves it's their
lookout  

 yes  i know  but you can't depend on them   it's the way they've acted
from the very start left us to do everything   they're so confiding and
mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all   so if we don't
give them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us 
and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off
perfectly flat  won't amount to nothing won't be nothing to it  

 well  as for me  tom  that's the way i'd like  

 shucks!  he says  and looked disgusted   so i says 

 but i ain't going to make no complaint   any way that suits you suits
me  what you going to do about the servant-girl  

 you'll be her   you slide in  in the middle of the night  and hook that
yaller girl's frock  

 why  tom  that 'll make trouble next morning  because  of course  she
prob'bly hain't got any but that one  

 i know  but you don't want it but fifteen minutes  to carry the
nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door  

 all right  then  i'll do it  but i could carry it just as handy in my
own togs  

 you wouldn't look like a servant-girl then  would you  

 no  but there won't be nobody to see what i look like  anyway  

 that ain't got nothing to do with it   the thing for us to do is just to
do our duty  and not worry about whether anybody sees us do it or not 
hain't you got no principle at all  

 all right  i ain't saying nothing  i'm the servant-girl   who's jim's
mother  

 i'm his mother   i'll hook a gown from aunt sally  

 well  then  you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and jim leaves  

 not much   i'll stuff jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
to represent his mother in disguise  and jim 'll take the nigger woman's
gown off of me and wear it  and we'll all evade together   when a
prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion   it's always called so
when a king escapes  f'rinstance   and the same with a king's son  it
don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one  

so tom he wrote the nonnamous letter  and i smouched the yaller wench's
frock that night  and put it on  and shoved it under the front door  the
way tom told me to   it said 

beware   trouble is brewing   keep a sharp lookout  unknown friend 

next night we stuck a picture  which tom drawed in blood  of a skull and
crossbones on the front door  and next night another one of a coffin on
the back door   i never see a family in such a sweat   they couldn't a
been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air   if a
door banged  aunt sally she jumped and said  ouch!  if anything fell  she
jumped and said  ouch!  if you happened to touch her  when she warn't
noticing  she done the same  she couldn't face noway and be satisfied 
because she allowed there was something behind her every time so she was
always a-whirling around sudden  and saying  ouch   and before she'd got
two-thirds around she'd whirl back again  and say it again  and she was
afraid to go to bed  but she dasn't set up   so the thing was working
very well  tom said  he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory 
he said it showed it was done right 

so he said  now for the grand bulge!  so the very next morning at the
streak of dawn we got another letter ready  and was wondering what we
better do with it  because we heard them say at supper they was going to
have a nigger on watch at both doors all night   tom he went down the
lightning-rod to spy around  and the nigger at the back door was asleep 
and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back   this letter said 

don't betray me  i wish to be your friend   there is a desprate gang of
cut-throats from over in the indian territory going to steal your runaway
nigger to-night  and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
stay in the house and not bother them   i am one of the gang  but have
got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again  and will
betray the helish design  they will sneak down from northards  along the
fence  at midnight exact  with a false key  and go in the nigger's cabin
to get him  i am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if i see any
danger  but stead of that i will ba like a sheep soon as they get in and
not blow at all  then whilst they are getting his chains loose  you slip
there and lock them in  and can kill them at your leasure   don't do
anything but just the way i am telling you  if you do they will suspicion
something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo  i do not wish any reward but to
know i have done the right thing  unknown friend 




we was feeling pretty good after breakfast  and took my canoe and went
over the river a-fishing  with a lunch  and had a good time  and took a
look at the raft and found her all right  and got home late to supper 
and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they
was standing on  and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
supper  and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was  and never let on a
word about the new letter  but didn't need to  because we knowed as much
about it as anybody did  and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed  and got up about
half-past eleven  and tom put on aunt sally's dress that he stole and
was going to start with the lunch  but says 

 where's the butter  

 i laid out a hunk of it   i says   on a piece of a corn-pone  

 well  you left it laid out  then it ain't here  

 we can get along without it   i says 

 we can get along with it  too   he says   just you slide down cellar and
fetch it   and then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along 
i'll go and stuff the straw into jim's clothes to represent his mother in
disguise  and be ready to ba like a sheep and shove soon as you get
there  

so out he went  and down cellar went i  the hunk of butter  big as a
person's fist  was where i had left it  so i took up the slab of
corn-pone with it on  and blowed out my light  and started up stairs very
stealthy  and got up to the main floor all right  but here comes aunt
sally with a candle  and i clapped the truck in my hat  and clapped my
hat on my head  and the next second she see me  and she says 

 you been down cellar  

 yes'm  

 what you been doing down there  

 noth'n  

 noth'n! 

 no'm  

 well  then  what possessed you to go down there this time of night  

 i don't know 'm  

 you don't know   don't answer me that way  tom  i want to know what you
been doing down there  

 i hain't been doing a single thing  aunt sally  i hope to gracious if i
have  

i reckoned she'd let me go now  and as a generl thing she would  but i
s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight  so she says 
very decided 

 you just march into that setting-room and stay there till i come   you
been up to something you no business to  and i lay i'll find out what it
is before i'm done with you  

so she went away as i opened the door and walked into the setting-room 
my  but there was a crowd there!  fifteen farmers  and every one of them
had a gun   i was most powerful sick  and slunk to a chair and set down 
they was setting around  some of them talking a little  in a low voice 
and all of them fidgety and uneasy  but trying to look like they warn't 
but i knowed they was  because they was always taking off their hats  and
putting them on  and scratching their heads  and changing their seats 
and fumbling with their buttons   i warn't easy myself  but i didn't take
my hat off  all the same 

i did wish aunt sally would come  and get done with me  and lick me  if
she wanted to  and let me get away and tell tom how we'd overdone this
thing  and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into  so we
could stop fooling around straight off  and clear out with jim before
these rips got out of patience and come for us 

at last she come and begun to ask me questions  but i couldn't answer
them straight  i didn't know which end of me was up  because these men
was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right now and lay
for them desperadoes  and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight 
and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
sheep-signal  and here was aunty pegging away at the questions  and me
a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks i was that scared 
and the place getting hotter and hotter  and the butter beginning to melt
and run down my neck and behind my ears  and pretty soon  when one of
them says   i'm for going and getting in the cabin first and right now 
and catching them when they come   i most dropped  and a streak of butter
come a-trickling down my forehead  and aunt sally she see it  and turns
white as a sheet  and says 

 for the land's sake  what is the matter with the child   he's got the
brain-fever as shore as you're born  and they're oozing out! 

and everybody runs to see  and she snatches off my hat  and out comes the
bread and what was left of the butter  and she grabbed me  and hugged me 
and says 

 oh  what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful i am it ain't
no worse  for luck's against us  and it never rains but it pours  and
when i see that truck i thought we'd lost you  for i knowed by the color
and all it was just like your brains would be if dear  dear  whyd'nt you
tell me that was what you'd been down there for  i wouldn't a cared   now
cler out to bed  and don't lemme see no more of you till morning! 

i was up stairs in a second  and down the lightning-rod in another one 
and shinning through the dark for the lean-to   i couldn't hardly get my
words out  i was so anxious  but i told tom as quick as i could we must
jump for it now  and not a minute to lose the house full of men  yonder 
with guns!

his eyes just blazed  and he says 

 no! is that so   ain't it bully!  why  huck  if it was to do over
again  i bet i could fetch two hundred!  if we could put it off till  

 hurry!  hurry!   i says    where's jim  

 right at your elbow  if you reach out your arm you can touch him   he's
dressed  and everything's ready   now we'll slide out and give the
sheep-signal  

but then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door  and heard them
begin to fumble with the pad-lock  and heard a man say 

 i told you we'd be too soon  they haven't come the door is locked 
here  i'll lock some of you into the cabin  and you lay for 'em in the
dark and kill 'em when they come  and the rest scatter around a piece 
and listen if you can hear 'em coming  

so in they come  but couldn't see us in the dark  and most trod on us
whilst we was hustling to get under the bed   but we got under all right 
and out through the hole  swift but soft jim first  me next  and tom
last  which was according to tom's orders   now we was in the lean-to 
and heard trampings close by outside   so we crept to the door  and tom
stopped us there and put his eye to the crack  but couldn't make out
nothing  it was so dark  and whispered and said he would listen for the
steps to get further  and when he nudged us jim must glide out first  and
him last   so he set his ear to the crack and listened  and listened  and
listened  and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time  and at
last he nudged us  and we slid out  and stooped down  not breathing  and
not making the least noise  and slipped stealthy towards the fence in
injun file  and got to it all right  and me and jim over it  but tom's
britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail  and then he hear the
steps coming  so he had to pull loose  which snapped the splinter and
made a noise  and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings
out 

 who's that   answer  or i'll shoot! 

but we didn't answer  we just unfurled our heels and shoved   then there
was a rush  and a bang  bang  bang! and the bullets fairly whizzed around
us! we heard them sing out 

 here they are!  they've broke for the river!  after 'em  boys  and turn
loose the dogs! 

so here they come  full tilt   we could hear them because they wore boots
and yelled  but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell   we was in the
path to the mill  and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into
the bush and let them go by  and then dropped in behind them   they'd had
all the dogs shut up  so they wouldn't scare off the robbers  but by this
time somebody had let them loose  and here they come  making powwow
enough for a million  but they was our dogs  so we stopped in our tracks
till they catched up  and when they see it warn't nobody but us  and no
excitement to offer them  they only just said howdy  and tore right ahead
towards the shouting and clattering  and then we up-steam again  and
whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill  and then struck
up through the bush to where my canoe was tied  and hopped in and pulled
for dear life towards the middle of the river  but didn't make no more
noise than we was obleeged to  then we struck out  easy and comfortable 
for the island where my raft was  and we could hear them yelling and
barking at each other all up and down the bank  till we was so far away
the sounds got dim and died out   and when we stepped on to the raft i
says 

 now  old jim  you're a free man again  and i bet you won't ever be a
slave no more  

 en a mighty good job it wuz  too  huck   it 'uz planned beautiful  en it
'uz done beautiful  en dey ain't nobody kin git up a plan dat's mo'
mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz  

we was all glad as we could be  but tom was the gladdest of all because
he had a bullet in the calf of his leg 

when me and jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before 
it was hurting him considerable  and bleeding  so we laid him in the
wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him  but he
says 

 gimme the rags  i can do it myself   don't stop now  don't fool around
here  and the evasion booming along so handsome  man the sweeps  and set
her loose!  boys  we done it elegant! 'deed we did   i wish we'd a had
the handling of louis xvi   there wouldn't a been no 'son of saint louis 
ascend to heaven!' wrote down in his biography  no  sir  we'd a whooped
him over the border that's what we'd a done with him and done it just
as slick as nothing at all  too   man the sweeps man the sweeps! 

but me and jim was consulting and thinking   and after we'd thought a
minute  i says 

 say it  jim  

so he says 

 well  den  dis is de way it look to me  huck   ef it wuz him dat 'uz
bein' sot free  en one er de boys wuz to git shot  would he say  'go on
en save me  nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one '  is dat like
mars tom sawyer   would he say dat   you bet he wouldn't!  well  den  is
jim gywne to say it   no  sah i doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout
a doctor  not if it's forty year! 

i knowed he was white inside  and i reckoned he'd say what he did say so
it was all right now  and i told tom i was a-going for a doctor   he
raised considerable row about it  but me and jim stuck to it and wouldn't
budge  so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself  but
we wouldn't let him   then he give us a piece of his mind  but it didn't
do no good 

so when he sees me getting the canoe ready  he says 

 well  then  if you re bound to go  i'll tell you the way to do when you
get to the village   shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
fast  and make him swear to be silent as the grave  and put a purse full
of gold in his hand  and then take and lead him all around the back
alleys and everywheres in the dark  and then fetch him here in the canoe 
in a roundabout way amongst the islands  and search him and take his
chalk away from him  and don't give it back to him till you get him back
to the village  or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again 
it's the way they all do  

so i said i would  and left  and jim was to hide in the woods when he see
the doctor coming till he was gone again 




the doctor was an old man  a very nice  kind-looking old man when i got
him up   i told him me and my brother was over on spanish island hunting
yesterday afternoon  and camped on a piece of a raft we found  and about
midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams  for it went off and shot
him in the leg  and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say
nothing about it  nor let anybody know  because we wanted to come home
this evening and surprise the folks 

 who is your folks   he says 

 the phelpses  down yonder  

 oh   he says   and after a minute  he says 

 how'd you say he got shot  

 he had a dream   i says   and it shot him  

 singular dream   he says 

so he lit up his lantern  and got his saddle-bags  and we started   but
when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her said she was big
enough for one  but didn't look pretty safe for two   i says 

 oh  you needn't be afeard  sir  she carried the three of us easy
enough  

 what three  

 why  me and sid  and and and the guns  that's what i mean  

 oh   he says 

but he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her  and shook his head  and
said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one   but they was all
locked and chained  so he took my canoe  and said for me to wait till he
come back  or i could hunt around further  or maybe i better go down home
and get them ready for the surprise if i wanted to   but i said i didn't 
so i told him just how to find the raft  and then he started 

i struck an idea pretty soon   i says to myself  spos'n he can't fix that
leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail  as the saying is  spos'n it
takes him three or four days   what are we going to do  lay around there
till he lets the cat out of the bag   no  sir  i know what i'll do   i'll
wait  and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more i'll get
down there  too  if i swim  and we'll take and tie him  and keep him  and
shove out down the river  and when tom's done with him we'll give him
what it's worth  or all we got  and then let him get ashore 

so then i crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep  and next time i
waked up the sun was away up over my head!  i shot out and went for the
doctor's house  but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or
other  and warn't back yet   well  thinks i  that looks powerful bad for
tom  and i'll dig out for the island right off   so away i shoved  and
turned the corner  and nearly rammed my head into uncle silas's stomach!
he says 

 why  tom!  where you been all this time  you rascal  

 i hain't been nowheres   i says   only just hunting for the runaway
nigger me and sid  

 why  where ever did you go   he says    your aunt's been mighty uneasy  

 she needn't   i says   because we was all right   we followed the men
and the dogs  but they outrun us  and we lost them  but we thought we
heard them on the water  so we got a canoe and took out after them and
crossed over  but couldn't find nothing of them  so we cruised along
up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out  and tied up the canoe
and went to sleep  and never waked up till about an hour ago  then we
paddled over here to hear the news  and sid's at the post-office to see
what he can hear  and i'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us 
and then we're going home  

so then we went to the post-office to get  sid   but just as i
suspicioned  he warn't there  so the old man he got a letter out of the
office  and we waited awhile longer  but sid didn't come  so the old man
said  come along  let sid foot it home  or canoe it  when he got done
fooling around but we would ride   i couldn't get him to let me stay and
wait for sid  and he said there warn't no use in it  and i must come
along  and let aunt sally see we was all right 

when we got home aunt sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried
both  and hugged me  and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't
amount to shucks  and said she'd serve sid the same when he come 

and the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives  to dinner  and
such another clack a body never heard   old mrs  hotchkiss was the worst 
her tongue was a-going all the time   she says 

 well  sister phelps  i've ransacked that-air cabin over  an' i b'lieve
the nigger was crazy   i says to sister damrell didn't i  sister
damrell  s'i  he's crazy  s'i them's the very words i said   you all
hearn me  he's crazy  s'i  everything shows it  s'i   look at that-air
grindstone  s'i  want to tell me't any cretur 't's in his right mind 's a
goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone  s'i   here
sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart  'n' here so 'n' so pegged along
for thirty-seven year  'n' all that natcherl son o' louis somebody  'n'
sich everlast'n rubbage   he's plumb crazy  s'i  it's what i says in the
fust place  it's what i says in the middle  'n' it's what i says last 'n'
all the time the nigger's crazy crazy 's nebokoodneezer  s'i  

 an' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags  sister hotchkiss   says old
mrs  damrell   what in the name o' goodness could he ever want of  

 the very words i was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to sister
utterback  'n' she'll tell you so herself   sh-she  look at that-air rag
ladder  sh-she  'n' s'i  yes  look at it  s'i what could he a-wanted of
it  s'i   sh-she  sister hotchkiss  sh-she  

 but how in the nation'd they ever git that grindstone in there  anyway 
'n' who dug that-air hole  'n' who  

 my very words  brer penrod!  i was a-sayin' pass that-air sasser o'
m'lasses  won't ye  i was a-sayin' to sister dunlap  jist this minute 
how did they git that grindstone in there  s'i   without help  mind you
 'thout help!  that's wher 'tis   don't tell me  s'i  there wuz help 
s'i  'n' ther' wuz a plenty help  too  s'i  ther's ben a dozen a-helpin'
that nigger  'n' i lay i'd skin every last nigger on this place but i'd
find out who done it  s'i  'n' moreover  s'i  

 a dozen says you! forty couldn't a done every thing that's been done 
look at them case-knife saws and things  how tedious they've been made 
look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm  a week's work for six men  look
at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed  and look at  

 you may well say it  brer hightower!  it's jist as i was a-sayin' to
brer phelps  his own self   s'e  what do you think of it  sister
hotchkiss  s'e  think o' what  brer phelps  s'i   think o' that bed-leg
sawed off that a way  s'e   think of it  s'i   i lay it never sawed
itself off  s'i somebody sawed it  s'i  that's my opinion  take it or
leave it  it mayn't be no 'count  s'i  but sich as 't is  it's my
opinion  s'i  'n' if any body k'n start a better one  s'i  let him do it 
s'i  that's all   i says to sister dunlap  s'i  

 why  dog my cats  they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there every
night for four weeks to a done all that work  sister phelps   look at
that shirt every last inch of it kivered over with secret african writ'n
done with blood!  must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along  all the
time  amost   why  i'd give two dollars to have it read to me  'n' as for
the niggers that wrote it  i 'low i'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll  

 people to help him  brother marples!  well  i reckon you'd think so if
you'd a been in this house for a while back   why  they've stole
everything they could lay their hands on and we a-watching all the time 
mind you  they stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that
sheet they made the rag ladder out of  ther' ain't no telling how many
times they didn't steal that  and flour  and candles  and candlesticks 
and spoons  and the old warming-pan  and most a thousand things that i
disremember now  and my new calico dress  and me and silas and my sid and
tom on the constant watch day and night  as i was a-telling you  and not
a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them  and
here at the last minute  lo and behold you  they slides right in under
our noses and fools us  and not only fools us but the injun territory
robbers too  and actuly gets away with that nigger safe and sound  and
that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at
that very time!  i tell you  it just bangs anything i ever heard of 
why  sperits couldn't a done better and been no smarter  and i reckon
they must a been sperits because  you know our dogs  and ther' ain't no
better  well  them dogs never even got on the track of 'm once!  you
explain that to me if you can! any of you! 

 well  it does beat  

 laws alive  i never  

 so help me  i wouldn't a be  

 house-thieves as well as  

 goodnessgracioussakes  i'd a ben afeard to live in sich a  

 'fraid to live! why  i was that scared i dasn't hardly go to bed  or
get up  or lay down  or set down  sister ridgeway   why  they'd steal the
very why  goodness sakes  you can guess what kind of a fluster i was
in by the time midnight come last night   i hope to gracious if i warn't
afraid they'd steal some o' the family!  i was just to that pass i didn't
have no reasoning faculties no more   it looks foolish enough now  in the
daytime  but i says to myself  there's my two poor boys asleep  'way up
stairs in that lonesome room  and i declare to goodness i was that uneasy
't i crep' up there and locked 'em in!  i did   and anybody would 
because  you know  when you get scared that way  and it keeps running on 
and getting worse and worse all the time  and your wits gets to addling 
and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things  and by and by you think to
yourself  spos'n i was a boy  and was away up there  and the door ain't
locked  and you   she stopped  looking kind of wondering  and then she
turned her head around slow  and when her eye lit on me i got up and
took a walk 

says i to myself  i can explain better how we come to not be in that room
this morning if i go out to one side and study over it a little   so i
done it   but i dasn't go fur  or she'd a sent for me   and when it was
late in the day the people all went  and then i come in and told her the
noise and shooting waked up me and  sid   and the door was locked  and we
wanted to see the fun  so we went down the lightning-rod  and both of us
got hurt a little  and we didn't never want to try that no more   and
then i went on and told her all what i told uncle silas before  and then
she said she'd forgive us  and maybe it was all right enough anyway  and
about what a body might expect of boys  for all boys was a pretty
harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see  and so  as long as no harm
hadn't come of it  she judged she better put in her time being grateful
we was alive and well and she had us still  stead of fretting over what
was past and done   so then she kissed me  and patted me on the head  and
dropped into a kind of a brown study  and pretty soon jumps up  and says 

 why  lawsamercy  it's most night  and sid not come yet!  what has become
of that boy  

i see my chance  so i skips up and says 

 i'll run right up to town and get him   i says 

 no you won't   she says    you'll stay right wher' you are  one's enough
to be lost at a time   if he ain't here to supper  your uncle 'll go  

well  he warn't there to supper  so right after supper uncle went 

he come back about ten a little bit uneasy  hadn't run across tom's
track  aunt sally was a good deal uneasy  but uncle silas he said there
warn't no occasion to be boys will be boys  he said  and you'll see this
one turn up in the morning all sound and right   so she had to be
satisfied   but she said she'd set up for him a while anyway  and keep a
light burning so he could see it 

and then when i went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her
candle  and tucked me in  and mothered me so good i felt mean  and like i
couldn't look her in the face  and she set down on the bed and talked
with me a long time  and said what a splendid boy sid was  and didn't
seem to want to ever stop talking about him  and kept asking me every now
and then if i reckoned he could a got lost  or hurt  or maybe drownded 
and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead  and she
not by him to help him  and so the tears would drip down silent  and i
would tell her that sid was all right  and would be home in the morning 
sure  and she would squeeze my hand  or maybe kiss me  and tell me to say
it again  and keep on saying it  because it done her good  and she was in
so much trouble   and when she was going away she looked down in my eyes
so steady and gentle  and says 

 the door ain't going to be locked  tom  and there's the window and the
rod  but you'll be good  won't you   and you won't go   for my sake  

laws knows i wanted to go bad enough to see about tom  and was all
intending to go  but after that i wouldn't a went  not for kingdoms 

but she was on my mind and tom was on my mind  so i slept very restless 
and twice i went down the rod away in the night  and slipped around
front  and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
eyes towards the road and the tears in them  and i wished i could do
something for her  but i couldn't  only to swear that i wouldn't never do
nothing to grieve her any more   and the third time i waked up at dawn 
and slid down  and she was there yet  and her candle was most out  and
her old gray head was resting on her hand  and she was asleep 




the old man was uptown again before breakfast  but couldn't get no track
of tom  and both of them set at the table thinking  and not saying
nothing  and looking mournful  and their coffee getting cold  and not
eating anything  and by and by the old man says 

 did i give you the letter  

 what letter  

 the one i got yesterday out of the post-office  

 no  you didn't give me no letter  

 well  i must a forgot it  

so he rummaged his pockets  and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down  and fetched it  and give it to her   she says 

 why  it's from st  petersburg it's from sis  

i allowed another walk would do me good  but i couldn't stir   but before
she could break it open she dropped it and run for she see something 
and so did i  it was tom sawyer on a mattress  and that old doctor  and
jim  in her calico dress  with his hands tied behind him  and a lot of
people   i hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy  and
rushed   she flung herself at tom  crying  and says 

 oh  he's dead  he's dead  i know he's dead! 

and tom he turned his head a little  and muttered something or other 
which showed he warn't in his right mind  then she flung up her hands 
and says 

 he's alive  thank god!  and that's enough!  and she snatched a kiss of
him  and flew for the house to get the bed ready  and scattering orders
right and left at the niggers and everybody else  as fast as her tongue
could go  every jump of the way 

i followed the men to see what they was going to do with jim  and the old
doctor and uncle silas followed after tom into the house   the men was
very huffy  and some of them wanted to hang jim for an example to all the
other niggers around there  so they wouldn't be trying to run away like
jim done  and making such a raft of trouble  and keeping a whole family
scared most to death for days and nights   but the others said  don't do
it  it wouldn't answer at all  he ain't our nigger  and his owner would
turn up and make us pay for him  sure   so that cooled them down a
little  because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a
nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the
most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of
him 

they cussed jim considerble  though  and give him a cuff or two side the
head once in a while  but jim never said nothing  and he never let on to
know me  and they took him to the same cabin  and put his own clothes on
him  and chained him again  and not to no bed-leg this time  but to a big
staple drove into the bottom log  and chained his hands  too  and both
legs  and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after
this till his owner come  or he was sold at auction because he didn't
come in a certain length of time  and filled up our hole  and said a
couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every
night  and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime  and about this time
they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl
good-bye cussing  and then the old doctor comes and takes a look  and
says 

 don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to  because he ain't a
bad nigger   when i got to where i found the boy i see i couldn't cut the
bullet out without some help  and he warn't in no condition for me to
leave to go and get help  and he got a little worse and a little worse 
and after a long time he went out of his head  and wouldn't let me come
a-nigh him any more  and said if i chalked his raft he'd kill me  and no
end of wild foolishness like that  and i see i couldn't do anything at
all with him  so i says  i got to have help somehow  and the minute i
says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help  and
he done it  too  and done it very well   of course i judged he must be a
runaway nigger  and there i was! and there i had to stick right straight
along all the rest of the day and all night   it was a fix  i tell you!
i had a couple of patients with the chills  and of course i'd of liked to
run up to town and see them  but i dasn't  because the nigger might get
away  and then i'd be to blame  and yet never a skiff come close enough
for me to hail   so there i had to stick plumb until daylight this
morning  and i never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller 
and yet he was risking his freedom to do it  and was all tired out  too 
and i see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately   i liked the
nigger for that  i tell you  gentlemen  a nigger like that is worth a
thousand dollars and kind treatment  too   i had everything i needed 
and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home better 
maybe  because it was so quiet  but there i was  with both of 'm on my
hands  and there i had to stick till about dawn this morning  then some
men in a skiff come by  and as good luck would have it the nigger was
setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep  so
i motioned them in quiet  and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and
tied him before he knowed what he was about  and we never had no trouble 
and the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep  too  we muffled the oars
and hitched the raft on  and towed her over very nice and quiet  and the
nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start   he ain't
no bad nigger  gentlemen  that's what i think about him  

somebody says 

 well  it sounds very good  doctor  i'm obleeged to say  

then the others softened up a little  too  and i was mighty thankful to
that old doctor for doing jim that good turn  and i was glad it was
according to my judgment of him  too  because i thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time i see him   then they all
agreed that jim had acted very well  and was deserving to have some
notice took of it  and reward   so every one of them promised  right out
and hearty  that they wouldn't cuss him no more 

then they come out and locked him up   i hoped they was going to say he
could have one or two of the chains took off  because they was rotten
heavy  or could have meat and greens with his bread and water  but they
didn't think of it  and i reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in  but i
judged i'd get the doctor's yarn to aunt sally somehow or other as soon
as i'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me
 explanations  i mean  of how i forgot to mention about sid being shot
when i was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
around hunting the runaway nigger 

but i had plenty time   aunt sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and
all night  and every time i see uncle silas mooning around i dodged him 

next morning i heard tom was a good deal better  and they said aunt sally
was gone to get a nap   so i slips to the sick-room  and if i found him
awake i reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash 
but he was sleeping  and sleeping very peaceful  too  and pale  not
fire-faced the way he was when he come   so i set down and laid for him
to wake   in about half an hour aunt sally comes gliding in  and there i
was  up a stump again!  she motioned me to be still  and set down by me 
and begun to whisper  and said we could all be joyful now  because all
the symptoms was first-rate  and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so
long  and looking better and peacefuller all the time  and ten to one
he'd wake up in his right mind 

so we set there watching  and by and by he stirs a bit  and opened his
eyes very natural  and takes a look  and says 

 hello! why  i'm at home!  how's that   where's the raft  

 it's all right   i says 

 and jim  

 the same   i says  but couldn't say it pretty brash   but he never
noticed  but says 

 good!  splendid!  now we're all right and safe! did you tell aunty  

i was going to say yes  but she chipped in and says    about what  sid  

 why  about the way the whole thing was done  

 what whole thing  

 why  the whole thing   there ain't but one  how we set the runaway
nigger free me and tom  

 good land!  set the run what is the child talking about!  dear  dear 
out of his head again! 

 no  i ain't out of my head  i know all what i'm talking about   we did
set him free me and tom   we laid out to do it  and we done it   and we
done it elegant  too    he'd got a start  and she never checked him up 
just set and stared and stared  and let him clip along  and i see it
warn't no use for me to put in    why  aunty  it cost us a power of work
 weeks of it hours and hours  every night  whilst you was all asleep 
and we had to steal candles  and the sheet  and the shirt  and your
dress  and spoons  and tin plates  and case-knives  and the warming-pan 
and the grindstone  and flour  and just no end of things  and you can't
think what work it was to make the saws  and pens  and inscriptions  and
one thing or another  and you can't think half the fun it was   and we
had to make up the pictures of coffins and things  and nonnamous letters
from the robbers  and get up and down the lightning-rod  and dig the hole
into the cabin  and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a
pie  and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket  

 mercy sakes! 

  and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on  for company for
jim  and then you kept tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
you come near spiling the whole business  because the men come before we
was out of the cabin  and we had to rush  and they heard us and let drive
at us  and i got my share  and we dodged out of the path and let them go
by  and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us  but went for the
most noise  and we got our canoe  and made for the raft  and was all
safe  and jim was a free man  and we done it all by ourselves  and wasn't
it bully  aunty! 

 well  i never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  so it was you 
you little rapscallions  that's been making all this trouble  and turned
everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death   i've
as good a notion as ever i had in my life to take it out o' you this very
minute   to think  here i've been  night after night  a you just get
well once  you young scamp  and i lay i'll tan the old harry out o' both
o' ye! 

but tom  he was so proud and joyful  he just couldn't hold in  and his
tongue just went it she a-chipping in  and spitting fire all along  and
both of them going it at once  like a cat convention  and she says 

 well  you get all the enjoyment you can out of it now  for mind i tell
you if i catch you meddling with him again  

 meddling with who    tom says  dropping his smile and looking surprised 

 with who   why  the runaway nigger  of course   who'd you reckon  

tom looks at me very grave  and says 

 tom  didn't you just tell me he was all right   hasn't he got away  

 him   says aunt sally   the runaway nigger   'deed he hasn't   they've
got him back  safe and sound  and he's in that cabin again  on bread and
water  and loaded down with chains  till he's claimed or sold! 

tom rose square up in bed  with his eye hot  and his nostrils opening and
shutting like gills  and sings out to me 

 they hain't no right to shut him up!  shove! and don't you lose a
minute   turn him loose! he ain't no slave  he's as free as any cretur
that walks this earth! 

 what does the child mean  

 i mean every word i say  aunt sally  and if somebody don't go  i'll go 
i've knowed him all his life  and so has tom  there   old miss watson
died two months ago  and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him
down the river  and said so  and she set him free in her will  

 then what on earth did you want to set him free for  seeing he was
already free  

 well  that is a question  i must say  and just like women!  why  i
wanted the adventure of it  and i'd a waded neck-deep in blood to
 goodness alive  aunt polly! 

if she warn't standing right there  just inside the door  looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie  i wish i may never!

aunt sally jumped for her  and most hugged the head off of her  and cried
over her  and i found a good enough place for me under the bed  for it
was getting pretty sultry for us  seemed to me   and i peeped out  and in
a little while tom's aunt polly shook herself loose and stood there
looking across at tom over her spectacles kind of grinding him into the
earth  you know   and then she says 

 yes  you better turn y'r head away i would if i was you  tom  

 oh  deary me!  says aunt sally   is he changed so   why  that ain't tom 
it's sid  tom's tom's why  where is tom   he was here a minute ago  

 you mean where's huck finn that's what you mean!  i reckon i hain't
raised such a scamp as my tom all these years not to know him when i see
him   that would be a pretty howdy-do   come out from under that bed 
huck finn  

so i done it   but not feeling brash 

aunt sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons i ever see
 except one  and that was uncle silas  when he come in and they told it
all to him   it kind of made him drunk  as you may say  and he didn't
know nothing at all the rest of the day  and preached a prayer-meeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation  because the oldest
man in the world couldn't a understood it   so tom's aunt polly  she told
all about who i was  and what  and i had to up and tell how i was in such
a tight place that when mrs  phelps took me for tom sawyer she chipped
in and says   oh  go on and call me aunt sally  i'm used to it now  and
'tain't no need to change  that when aunt sally took me for tom sawyer i
had to stand it there warn't no other way  and i knowed he wouldn't
mind  because it would be nuts for him  being a mystery  and he'd make an
adventure out of it  and be perfectly satisfied   and so it turned out 
and he let on to be sid  and made things as soft as he could for me 

and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting
jim free in her will  and so  sure enough  tom sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and i couldn't
ever understand before  until that minute and that talk  how he could
help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up 

well  aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and
sid had come all right and safe  she says to herself 

 look at that  now!  i might have expected it  letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him   so now i got to go and trapse all the
way down the river  eleven hundred mile  and find out what that creetur's
up to this time  as long as i couldn't seem to get any answer out of you
about it  

 why  i never heard nothing from you   says aunt sally 

 well  i wonder!  why  i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
by sid being here  

 well  i never got 'em  sis  

aunt polly she turns around slow and severe  and says 

 you  tom! 

 well what   he says  kind of pettish 

 don t you what me  you impudent thing hand out them letters  

 what letters  

 them letters   i be bound  if i have to take a-holt of you i'll  

 they're in the trunk   there  now   and they're just the same as they
was when i got them out of the office   i hain't looked into them  i
hain't touched them   but i knowed they'd make trouble  and i thought if
you warn't in no hurry  i'd  

 well  you do need skinning  there ain't no mistake about it   and i
wrote another one to tell you i was coming  and i s'pose he  

 no  it come yesterday  i hain't read it yet  but it's all right  i've
got that one  

i wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't  but i reckoned maybe it
was just as safe to not to   so i never said nothing 




the first time i catched tom private i asked him what was his idea  time
of the evasion  what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before 
and he said  what he had planned in his head from the start  if we got
jim out all safe  was for us to run him down the river on the raft  and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river  and then tell him about
his being free  and take him back up home on a steamboat  in style  and
pay him for his lost time  and write word ahead and get out all the
niggers around  and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brass-band  and then he would be a hero  and so would
we   but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was 

we had jim out of the chains in no time  and when aunt polly and uncle
silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom 
they made a heap of fuss over him  and fixed him up prime  and give him
all he wanted to eat  and a good time  and nothing to do   and we had him
up to the sick-room  and had a high talk  and tom give jim forty dollars
for being prisoner for us so patient  and doing it up so good  and jim
was pleased most to death  and busted out  and says 

 dah  now  huck  what i tell you  what i tell you up dah on jackson
islan'   i tole you i got a hairy breas'  en what's de sign un it  en i
tole you i ben rich wunst  en gwineter to be rich agin  en it's come
true  en heah she is!  dah  now! doan' talk to me signs is signs  mine i
tell you  en i knowed jis' 's well 'at i 'uz gwineter be rich agin as i's
a-stannin' heah dis minute! 

and then tom he talked along and talked along  and says  le's all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit  and go for
howling adventures amongst the injuns  over in the territory  for a
couple of weeks or two  and i says  all right  that suits me  but i ain't
got no money for to buy the outfit  and i reckon i couldn't get none from
home  because it's likely pap's been back before now  and got it all away
from judge thatcher and drunk it up 

 no  he hain't   tom says   it's all there yet six thousand dollars and
more  and your pap hain't ever been back since   hadn't when i come away 
anyhow  

jim says  kind of solemn 

 he ain't a-comin' back no mo'  huck  

i says 

 why  jim  

 nemmine why  huck but he ain't comin' back no mo  

but i kept at him  so at last he says 

 doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river  en dey wuz a
man in dah  kivered up  en i went in en unkivered him and didn' let you
come in   well  den  you kin git yo' money when you wants it  kase dat
wuz him  

tom's most well now  and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard
for a watch  and is always seeing what time it is  and so there ain't
nothing more to write about  and i am rotten glad of it  because if i'd a
knowed what a trouble it was to make a book i wouldn't a tackled it  and
ain't a-going to no more   but i reckon i got to light out for the
territory ahead of the rest  because aunt sally she's going to adopt me
and sivilize me  and i can't stand it   i been there before
