and tromped
to mush  and it was awful to see   children was heeling it ahead of the
mob  screaming and trying to get out of the way  and every window along
the road was full of women's heads  and there was nigger boys in every
tree  and bucks and wenches looking over every fence  and as soon as the
mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
reach   lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on  scared most
to death 

they swarmed up in front of sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam
together  and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise   it was a
little twenty-foot yard   some sung out  tear down the fence! tear down
the fence!   then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing 
and down she goes  and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like
a wave 

just then sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch 
with a double-barrel gun in his hand  and takes his stand  perfectly ca'm
and deliberate  not saying a word   the racket stopped  and the wave
sucked back 

sherburn never said a word just stood there  looking down   the
stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable   sherburn run his eye slow
along the crowd  and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
out-gaze him  but they couldn't  they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky 
then pretty soon sherburn sort of laughed  not the pleasant kind  but the
kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that's got sand
in it 

then he says  slow and scornful 

 the idea of you lynching anybody!  it's amusing   the idea of you
thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a man!  because you're brave
enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along
here  did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
man   why  a man's safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind as
long as it's daytime and you're not behind him 

 do i know you   i know you clear through was born and raised in the
south  and i've lived in the north  so i know the average all around 
the average man's a coward   in the north he lets anybody walk over him
that wants to  and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it 
in the south one man all by himself  has stopped a stage full of men in
the daytime  and robbed the lot   your newspapers call you a brave people
so much that you think you are braver than any other people whereas
you're just as brave  and no braver   why don't your juries hang
murderers   because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in
the back  in the dark and it's just what they would do 

 so they always acquit  and then a man goes in the night  with a hundred
masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal   your mistake is  that
you didn't bring a man with you  that's one mistake  and the other is
that you didn't come in the dark and fetch your masks   you brought part
of a man buck harkness  there and if you hadn't had him to start you 
you'd a taken it out in blowing 

 you didn't want to come   the average man don't like trouble and danger 
you don't like trouble and danger   but if only half a man like buck
harkness  there shouts 'lynch him! lynch him!' you're afraid to back
down afraid you'll be found out to be what you are cowards and so
you raise a yell  and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man's coat-tail 
and come raging up here  swearing what big things you're going to do 
the pitifulest thing out is a mob  that's what an army is a mob  they
don't fight with courage that's born in them  but with courage that's
borrowed from their mass  and from their officers   but a mob without any
man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness   now the thing for you to
do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole   if any real
lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark  southern
fashion  and when they come they'll bring their masks  and fetch a man
along   now leave and take your half-a-man with you  tossing his gun up
across his left arm and cocking it when he says this 

the crowd washed back sudden  and then broke all apart  and went tearing
off every which way  and buck harkness he heeled it after them  looking
tolerable cheap   i could a stayed if i wanted to  but i didn't want to 

i went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
went by  and then dived in under the tent   i had my twenty-dollar gold
piece and some other money  but i reckoned i better save it  because
there ain't no telling how soon you are going to need it  away from home
and amongst strangers that way   you can't be too careful   i ain't
opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way  but
there ain't no use in wasting it on them 

it was a real bully circus   it was the splendidest sight that ever was
when they all come riding in  two and two  a gentleman and lady  side by
side  the men just in their drawers and undershirts  and no shoes nor
stirrups  and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable
 there must a been twenty of them and every lady with a lovely
complexion  and perfectly beautiful  and looking just like a gang of real
sure-enough queens  and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars 
and just littered with diamonds   it was a powerful fine sight  i never
see anything so lovely   and then one by one they got up and stood  and
went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful  the men
looking ever so tall and airy and straight  with their heads bobbing and
skimming along  away up there under the tent-roof  and every lady's
rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips  and she looking
like the most loveliest parasol 

and then faster and faster they went  all of them dancing  first one foot
out in the air and then the other  the horses leaning more and more  and
the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole  cracking his whip
and shouting  hi! hi!  and the clown cracking jokes behind him  and by
and by all hands dropped the reins  and every lady put her knuckles on
her hips and every gentleman folded his arms  and then how the horses did
lean over and hump themselves!  and so one after the other they all
skipped off into the ring  and made the sweetest bow i ever see  and then
scampered out  and everybody clapped their hands and went just about
wild 

well  all through the circus they done the most astonishing things  and
all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people   the
ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said  and how he ever
could think of so many of them  and so sudden and so pat  was what i
couldn't noway understand  why  i couldn't a thought of them in a year 
and by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring said he wanted to
ride  said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was   they argued
and tried to keep him out  but he wouldn't listen  and the whole show
come to a standstill   then the people begun to holler at him and make
fun of him  and that made him mad  and he begun to rip and tear  so that
stirred up the people  and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
benches and swarm towards the ring  saying   knock him down! throw him
out!  and one or two women begun to scream   so  then  the ringmaster he
made a little speech  and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance 
and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would
let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse   so everybody
laughed and said all right  and the man got on  the minute he was on  the
horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around  with two circus
men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him  and the drunk man
hanging on to his neck  and his heels flying in the air every jump  and
the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears
rolled down   and at last  sure enough  all the circus men could do  the
horse broke loose  and away he went like the very nation  round and round
the ring  with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck  with
first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side  and then t'other
one on t'other side  and the people just crazy   it warn't funny to me 
though  i was all of a tremble to see his danger   but pretty soon he
struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle  a-reeling this way and
that  and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood!
and the horse a-going like a house afire too   he just stood up there 
a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his
life and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them   he shed
them so thick they kind of clogged up the air  and altogether he shed
seventeen suits  and  then  there he was  slim and handsome  and dressed
the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw  and he lit into that horse with
his whip and made him fairly hum and finally skipped off  and made his
bow and danced off to the dressing-room  and everybody just a-howling
with pleasure and astonishment 

then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled  and he was the sickest
ringmaster you ever see  i reckon   why  it was one of his own men!  he
had got up that joke all out of his own head  and never let on to nobody 
well  i felt sheepish enough to be took in so  but i wouldn't a been in
that ringmaster's place  not for a thousand dollars   i don't know  there
may be bullier circuses than what that one was  but i never struck them
yet  anyways  it was plenty good enough for me  and wherever i run across
it  it can have all of my custom every time 

well  that night we had our show  but there warn't only about twelve
people there just enough to pay expenses   and they laughed all the
time  and that made the duke mad  and everybody left  anyway  before the
show was over  but one boy which was asleep   so the duke said these
arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to shakespeare  what they wanted was
low comedy and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy  he
reckoned   he said he could size their style   so next morning he got
some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint  and drawed off
some handbills  and stuck them up all over the village   the bills said 

at the court house! for 3 nights only!
the world-renowned tragedians
david garrick the younger!
and edmund kean the elder!
of the london and
continental theatres 
in their thrilling tragedy of
the king's cameleopard 
or the royal nonesuch ! ! !
admission 50 cents 

then at the bottom was the biggest line of all  which said 

ladies and children not admitted 

 there   says he   if that line don't fetch them  i don't know arkansaw! 




well  all day him and the king was hard at it  rigging up a stage and a
curtain and a row of candles for footlights  and that night the house was
jam full of men in no time   when the place couldn't hold no more  the
duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the
stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech  and
praised up this tragedy  and said it was the most thrillingest one that
ever was  and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy  and about
edmund kean the elder  which was to play the main principal part in it 
and at last when he'd got everybody's expectations up high enough  he
rolled up the curtain  and the next minute the king come a-prancing out
on all fours  naked  and he was painted all over  ring-streaked-and-
striped  all sorts of colors  as splendid as a rainbow   and but never
mind the rest of his outfit  it was just wild  but it was awful funny 
the people most killed themselves laughing  and when the king got done
capering and capered off behind the scenes  they roared and clapped and
stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again  and after
that they made him do it another time  well  it would make a cow laugh to
see the shines that old idiot cut 

then the duke he lets the curtain down  and bows to the people  and says
the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more  on accounts of
pressing london engagements  where the seats is all sold already for it
in drury lane  and then he makes them another bow  and says if he has
succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them  he will be deeply
obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
and see it 

twenty people sings out 

 what  is it over   is that all  

the duke says yes   then there was a fine time   everybody sings out 
 sold!  and rose up mad  and was a-going for that stage and them
tragedians   but a big  fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts 

 hold on!  just a word  gentlemen    they stopped to listen    we are
sold mighty badly sold   but we don't want to be the laughing stock of
this whole town  i reckon  and never hear the last of this thing as long
as we live   no   what we want is to go out of here quiet  and talk this
show up  and sell the rest of the town!  then we'll all be in the same
boat   ain't that sensible   ( you bet it is! the jedge is right! 
everybody sings out )  all right  then not a word about any sell   go
along home  and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy  

next day you couldn't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that
show was   house was jammed again that night  and we sold this crowd the
same way   when me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all
had a supper  and by and by  about midnight  they made jim and me back
her out and float her down the middle of the river  and fetch her in and
hide her about two mile below town 

the third night the house was crammed again and they warn't new-comers
this time  but people that was at the show the other two nights   i stood
by the duke at the door  and i see that every man that went in had his
pockets bulging  or something muffled up under his coat and i see it
warn't no perfumery  neither  not by a long sight   i smelt sickly eggs
by the barrel  and rotten cabbages  and such things  and if i know the
signs of a dead cat being around  and i bet i do  there was sixty-four of
them went in   i shoved in there for a minute  but it was too various for
me  i couldn't stand it   well  when the place couldn't hold no more
people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for
him a minute  and then he started around for the stage door  i after him 
but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says 

 walk fast now till you get away from the houses  and then shin for the
raft like the dickens was after you! 

i done it  and he done the same   we struck the raft at the same time 
and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream  all dark and
still  and edging towards the middle of the river  nobody saying a word 
i reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience 
but nothing of the sort  pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam 
and says 

 well  how'd the old thing pan out this time  duke    he hadn't been
up-town at all 

we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village 
then we lit up and had a supper  and the king and the duke fairly laughed
their bones loose over the way they'd served them people   the duke says 

 greenhorns  flatheads!  i knew the first house would keep mum and let
the rest of the town get roped in  and i knew they'd lay for us the third
night  and consider it was their turn now   well  it is their turn  and
i'd give something to know how much they'd take for it   i would just
like to know how they're putting in their opportunity   they can turn it
into a picnic if they want to they brought plenty provisions  

them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that
three nights   i never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that
before   by and by  when they was asleep and snoring  jim says 

 don't it s'prise you de way dem kings carries on  huck  

 no   i says   it don't  

 why don't it  huck  

 well  it don't  because it's in the breed   i reckon they're all alike  

 but  huck  dese kings o' ourn is reglar rapscallions  dat's jist what
dey is  dey's reglar rapscallions  

 well  that's what i'm a-saying  all kings is mostly rapscallions  as fur
as i can make out  

 is dat so  

 you read about them once you'll see   look at henry the eight  this 'n
's a sunday-school superintendent to him   and look at charles second 
and louis fourteen  and louis fifteen  and james second  and edward
second  and richard third  and forty more  besides all them saxon
heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise cain   my 
you ought to seen old henry the eight when he was in bloom   he was a
blossom   he used to marry a new wife every day  and chop off her head
next morning   and he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs   'fetch up nell gwynn ' he says   they fetch her up 
next morning  'chop off her head!'  and they chop it off   'fetch up jane
shore ' he says  and up she comes  next morning  'chop off her head' and
they chop it off   'ring up fair rosamun '  fair rosamun answers the
bell   next morning  'chop off her head '  and he made every one of them
tell him a tale every night  and he kept that up till he had hogged a
thousand and one tales that way  and then he put them all in a book  and
called it domesday book which was a good name and stated the case   you
don't know kings  jim  but i know them  and this old rip of ourn is one
of the cleanest i've struck in history   well  henry he takes a notion he
wants to get up some trouble with this country  how does he go at it
 give notice  give the country a show   no   all of a sudden he heaves
all the tea in boston harbor overboard  and whacks out a declaration of
independence  and dares them to come on   that was his style he never
give anybody a chance   he had suspicions of his father  the duke of
wellington   well  what did he do   ask him to show up   no drownded
him in a butt of mamsey  like a cat   s'pose people left money laying
around where he was what did he do   he collared it   s'pose he
contracted to do a thing  and you paid him  and didn't set down there and
see that he done it what did he do   he always done the other thing 
s'pose he opened his mouth what then   if he didn't shut it up powerful
quick he'd lose a lie every time   that's the kind of a bug henry was 
and if we'd a had him along 'stead of our kings he'd a fooled that town a
heap worse than ourn done   i don't say that ourn is lambs  because they
ain't  when you come right down to the cold facts  but they ain't nothing
to that old ram  anyway   all i say is  kings is kings  and you got to
make allowances   take them all around  they're a mighty ornery lot 
it's the way they're raised  

 but dis one do smell so like de nation  huck  

 well  they all do  jim   we can't help the way a king smells  history
don't tell no way  

 now de duke  he's a tolerble likely man in some ways  

 yes  a duke's different   but not very different   this one's a middling
hard lot for a duke   when he's drunk there ain't no near-sighted man
could tell him from a king  

 well  anyways  i doan' hanker for no mo' un um  huck   dese is all i kin
stan'  

 it's the way i feel  too  jim   but we've got them on our hands  and we
got to remember what they are  and make allowances   sometimes i wish we
could hear of a country that's out of kings  

what was the use to tell jim these warn't real kings and dukes   it
wouldn't a done no good  and  besides  it was just as i said   you
couldn't tell them from the real kind 

i went to sleep  and jim didn't call me when it was my turn   he often
done that   when i waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees  moaning and mourning to himself   i
didn't take notice nor let on   i knowed what it was about   he was
thinking about his wife and his children  away up yonder  and he was low
and homesick  because he hadn't ever been away from home before in his
life  and i do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for their'n   it don't seem natural  but i reckon it's so   he
was often moaning and mourning that way nights  when he judged i was
asleep  and saying   po' little 'lizabeth! po' little johnny! it's mighty
hard  i spec' i ain't ever gwyne to see you no mo'  no mo'!   he was a
mighty good nigger  jim was 

but this time i somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
ones  and by and by he says 

 what makes me feel so bad dis time 'uz bekase i hear sumpn over yonder
on de bank like a whack  er a slam  while ago  en it mine me er de time i
treat my little 'lizabeth so ornery   she warn't on'y 'bout fo' year ole

long's he live!'  oh  she was plumb deef en dumb  huck  plumb deef en
dumb en i'd ben a-treat'n her so! 




next day  towards night  we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle  where there was a village on each side of the river  and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns   jim he
spoke to the duke  and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few hours 
because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all
day in the wigwam tied with the rope   you see  when we left him all
alone we had to tie him  because if anybody happened on to him all by
himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway nigger 
you know  so the duke said it was kind of hard to have to lay roped all
day  and he'd cipher out some way to get around it 

he was uncommon bright  the duke was  and he soon struck it   he dressed
jim up in king lear's outfit it was a long curtain-calico gown  and a
white horse-hair wig and whiskers  and then he took his theater paint and
painted jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead  dull 
solid blue  like a man that's been drownded nine days   blamed if he
warn't the horriblest looking outrage i ever see   then the duke took and
wrote out a sign on a shingle so 

sick arab but harmless when not out of his head 

and he nailed that shingle to a lath  and stood the lath up four or five
foot in front of the wigwam   jim was satisfied   he said it was a sight
better than lying tied a couple of years every day  and trembling all
over every time there was a sound   the duke told him to make himself
free and easy  and if anybody ever come meddling around  he must hop out
of the wigwam  and carry on a little  and fetch a howl or two like a wild
beast  and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone   which
was sound enough judgment  but you take the average man  and he wouldn't
wait for him to howl   why  he didn't only look like he was dead  he
looked considerable more than that 

these rapscallions wanted to try the nonesuch again  because there was so
much money in it  but they judged it wouldn't be safe  because maybe the
news might a worked along down by this time   they couldn't hit no
project that suited exactly  so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd
lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up
something on the arkansaw village  and the king he allowed he would drop
over to t'other village without any plan  but just trust in providence to
lead him the profitable way meaning the devil  i reckon   we had all
bought store clothes where we stopped last  and now the king put his'n
on  and he told me to put mine on   i done it  of course   the king's
duds was all black  and he did look real swell and starchy   i never
knowed how clothes could change a body before   why  before  he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was  but now  when he'd take off his
new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile  he looked that grand and
good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark  and
maybe was old leviticus himself   jim cleaned up the canoe  and i got my
paddle ready   there was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up
under the point  about three mile above the town been there a couple
of hours  taking on freight   says the king 

 seein' how i'm dressed  i reckon maybe i better arrive down from st 
louis or cincinnati  or some other big place   go for the steamboat 
huckleberry  we'll come down to the village on her  

i didn't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride   i
fetched the shore a half a mile above the village  and then went scooting
along the bluff bank in the easy water   pretty soon we come to a nice
innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat
off of his face  for it was powerful warm weather  and he had a couple of
big carpet-bags by him 

 run her nose in shore   says the king   i done it    wher' you bound
for  young man  

 for the steamboat  going to orleans  

 git aboard   says the king    hold on a minute  my servant 'll he'p you
with them bags   jump out and he'p the gentleman  adolphus  meaning me 
i see 

i done so  and then we all three started on again   the young chap was
mighty thankful  said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather 
he asked the king where he was going  and the king told him he'd come
down the river and landed at the other village this morning  and now he
was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there   the
young fellow says 

 when i first see you i says to myself  'it's mr  wilks  sure  and he
come mighty near getting here in time '  but then i says again  'no  i
reckon it ain't him  or else he wouldn't be paddling up the river '  you
ain't him  are you  

 no  my name's blodgett elexander blodgett reverend elexander blodgett 
i s'pose i must say  as i'm one o' the lord's poor servants   but still
i'm jist as able to be sorry for mr  wilks for not arriving in time  all
the same  if he's missed anything by it which i hope he hasn't  

 well  he don't miss any property by it  because he'll get that all
right  but he's missed seeing his brother peter die which he mayn't
mind  nobody can tell as to that but his brother would a give anything
in this world to see him before he died  never talked about nothing else
all these three weeks  hadn't seen him since they was boys together and
hadn't ever seen his brother william at all that's the deef and dumb
one william ain't more than thirty or thirty-five   peter and george
were the only ones that come out here  george was the married brother 
him and his wife both died last year   harvey and william's the only ones
that's left now  and  as i was saying  they haven't got here in time  

 did anybody send 'em word  

 oh  yes  a month or two ago  when peter was first took  because peter
said then that he sorter felt like he warn't going to get well this time 
you see  he was pretty old  and george's g'yirls was too young to be much
company for him  except mary jane  the red-headed one  and so he was
kinder lonesome after george and his wife died  and didn't seem to care
much to live   he most desperately wanted to see harvey and william 
too  for that matter because he was one of them kind that can't bear to
make a will   he left a letter behind for harvey  and said he'd told in
it where his money was hid  and how he wanted the rest of the property
divided up so george's g'yirls would be all right for george didn't
leave nothing   and that letter was all they could get him to put a pen
to  

 why do you reckon harvey don't come   wher' does he live  

 oh  he lives in england sheffield preaches there hasn't ever been in
this country   he hasn't had any too much time and besides he mightn't a
got the letter at all  you know  

 too bad  too bad he couldn't a lived to see his brothers  poor soul 
you going to orleans  you say  

 yes  but that ain't only a part of it   i'm going in a ship  next
wednesday  for ryo janeero  where my uncle lives  

 it's a pretty long journey   but it'll be lovely  wisht i was a-going 
is mary jane the oldest   how old is the others  

 mary jane's nineteen  susan's fifteen  and joanna's about fourteen
 that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip  


 poor things! to be left alone in the cold world so  

 well  they could be worse off   old peter had friends  and they ain't
going to let them come to no harm   there's hobson  the babtis' preacher 
and deacon lot hovey  and ben rucker  and abner shackleford  and levi
bell  the lawyer  and dr  robinson  and their wives  and the widow
bartley  and well  there's a lot of them  but these are the ones that
peter was thickest with  and used to write about sometimes  when he wrote
home  so harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here  

well  the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
that young fellow   blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and
everything in that blessed town  and all about the wilkses  and about
peter's business which was a tanner  and about george's which was a
carpenter  and about harvey's which was a dissentering minister  and so
on  and so on   then he says 

 what did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for  

 because she's a big orleans boat  and i was afeard she mightn't stop
there   when they're deep they won't stop for a hail   a cincinnati boat
will  but this is a st  louis one  

 was peter wilks well off  

 oh  yes  pretty well off   he had houses and land  and it's reckoned he
left three or four thousand in cash hid up som'ers  

 when did you say he died  

 i didn't say  but it was last night  

 funeral to-morrow  likely  

 yes  'bout the middle of the day  

 well  it's all terrible sad  but we've all got to go  one time or
another  so what we want to do is to be prepared  then we're all right  

 yes  sir  it's the best way   ma used to always say that  

when we struck the boat she was about done loading  and pretty soon she
got off   the king never said nothing about going aboard  so i lost my
ride  after all   when the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
another mile to a lonesome place  and then he got ashore and says 

 now hustle back  right off  and fetch the duke up here  and the new
carpet-bags   and if he's gone over to t'other side  go over there and
git him   and tell him to git himself up regardless   shove along  now  

i see what he was up to  but i never said nothing  of course   when i got
back with the duke we hid the canoe  and then they set down on a log  and
the king told him everything  just like the young fellow had said it
 every last word of it   and all the time he was a-doing it he tried to
talk like an englishman  and he done it pretty well  too  for a slouch 
i can't imitate him  and so i ain't a-going to try to  but he really done
it pretty good   then he says 

 how are you on the deef and dumb  bilgewater  

the duke said  leave him alone for that  said he had played a deef and
dumb person on the histronic boards   so then they waited for a
steamboat 

about the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along 
but they didn't come from high enough up the river  but at last there was
a big one  and they hailed her   she sent out her yawl  and we went
aboard  and she was from cincinnati  and when they found we only wanted
to go four or five mile they was booming mad  and gave us a cussing  and
said they wouldn't land us   but the king was ca'm   he says 

 if gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
put off in a yawl  a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em  can't it  

so they softened down and said it was all right  and when we got to the
village they yawled us ashore   about two dozen men flocked down when
they see the yawl a-coming  and when the king says 

 kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' mr  peter wilks lives   they give
a glance at one another  and nodded their heads  as much as to say   what
d' i tell you    then one of them says  kind of soft and gentle 

 i'm sorry sir  but the best we can do is to tell you where he did live
yesterday evening  

sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash  and fell up
against the man  and put his chin on his shoulder  and cried down his
back  and says 

 alas  alas  our poor brother gone  and we never got to see him  oh 
it's too  too hard! 

then he turns around  blubbering  and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the
duke on his hands  and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and bust out
a-crying   if they warn't the beatenest lot  them two frauds  that ever i
struck 

well  the men gathered around and sympathized with them  and said all
sorts of kind things to them  and carried their carpet-bags up the hill
for them  and let them lean on them and cry  and told the king all about
his brother's last moments  and the king he told it all over again on his
hands to the duke  and both of them took on about that dead tanner like
they'd lost the twelve disciples   well  if ever i struck anything like
it  i'm a nigger  it was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race 




the news was all over town in two minutes  and you could see the people
tearing down on the run from every which way  some of them putting on
their coats as they come   pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd 
and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march   the windows and
dooryards was full  and every minute somebody would say  over a fence 

 is it them  

and somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say 

 you bet it is  

when we got to the house the street in front of it was packed  and the
three girls was standing in the door   mary jane was red-headed  but that
don't make no difference  she was most awful beautiful  and her face and
her eyes was all lit up like glory  she was so glad her uncles was come 
the king he spread his arms  and mary jane she jumped for them  and the
hare-lip jumped for the duke  and there they had it!  everybody most 
leastways women  cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have
such good times 

then the king he hunched the duke private i see him do it and then he
looked around and see the coffin  over in the corner on two chairs  so
then him and the duke  with a hand across each other's shoulder  and
t'other hand to their eyes  walked slow and solemn over there  everybody
dropping back to give them room  and all the talk and noise stopping 
people saying  sh!  and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads  so you could a heard a pin fall   and when they got there
they bent over and looked in the coffin  and took one sight  and then
they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to orleans  most  and
then they put their arms around each other's necks  and hung their chins
over each other's shoulders  and then for three minutes  or maybe four  i
never see two men leak the way they done   and  mind you  everybody was
doing the same  and the place was that damp i never see anything like it 
then one of them got on one side of the coffin  and t'other on t'other
side  and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin  and
let on to pray all to themselves   well  when it come to that it worked
the crowd like you never see anything like it  and everybody broke down
and went to sobbing right out loud the poor girls  too  and every woman 
nearly  went up to the girls  without saying a word  and kissed them 
solemn  on the forehead  and then put their hand on their head  and
looked up towards the sky  with the tears running down  and then busted
out and went off sobbing and swabbing  and give the next woman a show   i
never see anything so disgusting 

well  by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little  and works
himself up and slobbers out a speech  all full of tears and flapdoodle
about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
diseased  and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of
four thousand mile  but it's a trial that's sweetened and sanctified to
us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears  and so he thanks them out
of his heart and out of his brother's heart  because out of their mouths
they can't  words being too weak and cold  and all that kind of rot and
slush  till it was just sickening  and then he blubbers out a pious
goody-goody amen  and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust 

and the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
struck up the doxolojer  and everybody joined in with all their might 
and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting
out  music is a good thing  and after all that soul-butter and hogwash i
never see it freshen up things so  and sound so honest and bully 

then the king begins to work his jaw again  and says how him and his
nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
would take supper here with them this evening  and help set up with the
ashes of the diseased  and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
speak he knows who he would name  for they was names that was very dear
to him  and mentioned often in his letters  and so he will name the same 
to wit  as follows  vizz   rev  mr  hobson  and deacon lot hovey  and
mr  ben rucker  and abner shackleford  and levi bell  and dr  robinson 
and their wives  and the widow bartley 

rev  hobson and dr  robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting
together that is  i mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t'other
world  and the preacher was pinting him right   lawyer bell was away up
to louisville on business   but the rest was on hand  and so they all
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him  and
then they shook hands with the duke and didn't say nothing  but just kept
a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he
made all sorts of signs with his hands and said  goo-goo goo-goo-goo 
all the time  like a baby that can't talk 

so the king he blattered along  and managed to inquire about pretty much
everybody and dog in town  by his name  and mentioned all sorts of little
things that happened one time or another in the town  or to george's
family  or to peter   and he always let on that peter wrote him the
things  but that was a lie   he got every blessed one of them out of that
young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat 

then mary jane she fetched the letter her father left behind  and the
king he read it out loud and cried over it   it give the dwelling-house
and three thousand dollars  gold  to the girls  and it give the tanyard
(which was doing a good business)  along with some other houses and land
(worth about seven thousand)  and three thousand dollars in gold to
harvey and william  and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
cellar   so these two frauds said they'd go and fetch it up  and have
everything square and above-board  and told me to come with a candle   we
shut the cellar door behind us  and when they found the bag they spilt it
out on the floor  and it was a lovely sight  all them yaller-boys   my 
the way the king's eyes did shine!  he slaps the duke on the shoulder and
says 

 oh  this ain't bully nor noth'n!  oh  no  i reckon not!  why  billy  it
beats the nonesuch  don't it  

the duke allowed it did   they pawed the yaller-boys  and sifted them
through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor  and the king
says 

 it ain't no use talkin'  bein' brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs that's got left is the line for you and
me  bilge   thish yer comes of trust'n to providence   it's the best way 
in the long run   i've tried 'em all  and ther' ain't no better way  

most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile  and took it on
trust  but no  they must count it   so they counts it  and it comes out
four hundred and fifteen dollars short   says the king 

 dern him  i wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
dollars  

they worried over that awhile  and ransacked all around for it   then the
duke says 

 well  he was a pretty sick man  and likely he made a mistake i reckon
that's the way of it   the best way's to let it go  and keep still about
it   we can spare it  

 oh  shucks  yes  we can spare it   i don't k'yer noth'n 'bout that it's
the count i'm thinkin' about   we want to be awful square and open and
above-board here  you know   we want to lug this h-yer money up stairs
and count it before everybody then ther' ain't noth'n suspicious   but
when the dead man says ther's six thous'n dollars  you know  we don't
want to  

 hold on   says the duke    le's make up the deffisit   and he begun to
haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket 

 it's a most amaz'n' good idea  duke you have got a rattlin' clever head
on you   says the king    blest if the old nonesuch ain't a heppin' us
out agin   and he begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up 

it most busted them  but they made up the six thousand clean and clear 

 say   says the duke   i got another idea   le's go up stairs and count
this money  and then take and give it to the girls  

 good land  duke  lemme hug you!  it's the most dazzling idea 'at ever a
man struck   you have cert'nly got the most astonishin' head i ever see 
oh  this is the boss dodge  ther' ain't no mistake 'bout it   let 'em
fetch along their suspicions now if they want to this 'll lay 'em out  

when we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table  and the king
he counted it and stacked it up  three hundred dollars in a pile twenty
elegant little piles   everybody looked hungry at it  and licked their
chops   then they raked it into the bag again  and i see the king begin
to swell himself up for another speech   he says 

 friends all  my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them
that's left behind in the vale of sorrers   he has done generous by these
yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered  and that's left
fatherless and motherless   yes  and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done more generous by 'em if he hadn't ben afeard o' woundin' his
dear william and me   now  wouldn't he   ther' ain't no question 'bout it
in my mind   well  then  what kind o' brothers would it be that 'd stand
in his way at sech a time   and what kind o' uncles would it be that 'd
rob yes  rob sech poor sweet lambs as these 'at he loved so at sech a
time   if i know william and i think i do he well  i'll jest ask him  
he turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his
hands  and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while 
then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning  and jumps for the
king  goo-gooing with all his might for joy  and hugs him about fifteen
times before he lets up   then the king says   i knowed it  i reckon that
'll convince anybody the way he feels about it   here  mary jane  susan 
joanner  take the money take it all   it's the gift of him that lays
yonder  cold but joyful  

mary jane she went for him  susan and the hare-lip went for the duke  and
then such another hugging and kissing i never see yet   and everybody
crowded up with the tears in their eyes  and most shook the hands off of
them frauds  saying all the time 

 you dear good souls! how lovely! how could you! 

well  then  pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
again  and how good he was  and what a loss he was  and all that  and
before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside 
and stood a-listening and looking  and not saying anything  and nobody
saying anything to him either  because the king was talking and they was
all busy listening   the king was saying in the middle of something he'd
started in on 

  they bein' partickler friends o' the diseased   that's why they're
invited here this evenin'  but tomorrow we want all to come everybody 
for he respected everybody  he liked everybody  and so it's fitten that
his funeral orgies sh'd be public  

and so he went a-mooning on and on  liking to hear himself talk  and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again  till the duke
he couldn't stand it no more  so he writes on a little scrap of paper 
 obsequies  you old fool   and folds it up  and goes to goo-gooing and
reaching it over people's heads to him   the king he reads it and puts it
in his pocket  and says 

 poor william  afflicted as he is  his heart's aluz right   asks me to
invite everybody to come to the funeral wants me to make 'em all
welcome   but he needn't a worried it was jest what i was at  

then he weaves along again  perfectly ca'm  and goes to dropping in his
funeral orgies again every now and then  just like he done before   and
when he done it the third time he says 

 i say orgies  not because it's the common term  because it ain't
 obsequies bein' the common term but because orgies is the right term 
obsequies ain't used in england no more now it's gone out   we say
orgies now in england   orgies is better  because it means the thing
you're after more exact   it's a word that's made up out'n the greek
orgo  outside  open  abroad  and the hebrew jeesum  to plant  cover up 
hence inter   so  you see  funeral orgies is an open er public funeral  

he was the worst i ever struck   well  the iron-jawed man he laughed
right in his face   everybody was shocked   everybody says   why 
doctor!  and abner shackleford says 

 why  robinson  hain't you heard the news   this is harvey wilks  

the king he smiled eager  and shoved out his flapper  and says 

 is it my poor brother's dear good friend and physician   i  

 keep your hands off of me!  says the doctor    you talk like an
englishman  don't you   it's the worst imitation i ever heard   you peter
wilks's brother!  you're a fraud  that's what you are! 

well  how they all took on!  they crowded around the doctor and tried to
quiet him down  and tried to explain to him and tell him how harvey 'd
showed in forty ways that he was harvey  and knowed everybody by name 
and the names of the very dogs  and begged and begged him not to hurt
harvey's feelings and the poor girl's feelings  and all that   but it
warn't no use  he stormed right along  and said any man that pretended to
be an englishman and couldn't imitate the lingo no better than what he
did was a fraud and a liar   the poor girls was hanging to the king and
crying  and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on them   he says 

 i was your father's friend  and i'm your friend  and i warn you as a
friend  and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble  to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him  the ignorant tramp  with his idiotic greek and hebrew  as
he calls it   he is the thinnest kind of an impostor has come here with
a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres  and you
take them for proofs  and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish
friends here  who ought to know better   mary jane wilks  you know me for
your friend  and for your unselfish friend  too   now listen to me  turn
this pitiful rascal out i beg you to do it   will you  

mary jane straightened herself up  and my  but she was handsome!  she
says 

 here is my answer    she hove up the bag of money and put it in the
king's hands  and says   take this six thousand dollars  and invest for
me and my sisters any way you want to  and don't give us no receipt for
it  

then she put her arm around the king on one side  and susan and the
hare-lip done the same on the other   everybody clapped their hands and
stomped on the floor like a perfect storm  whilst the king held up his
head and smiled proud   the doctor says 

 all right  i wash my hands of the matter   but i warn you all that a
time 's coming when you're going to feel sick whenever you think of this
day   and away he went 

 all right  doctor   says the king  kinder mocking him   we'll try and
get 'em to send for you   which made them all laugh  and they said it was
a prime good hit 




well  when they was all gone the king he asks mary jane how they was off
for spare rooms  and she said she had one spare room  which would do for
uncle william  and she'd give her own room to uncle harvey  which was a
little bigger  and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
sleep on a cot  and up garret was a little cubby  with a pallet in it 
the king said the cubby would do for his valley meaning me 

so mary jane took us up  and she showed them their rooms  which was plain
but nice   she said she'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took
out of her room if they was in uncle harvey's way  but he said they
warn't   the frocks was hung along the wall  and before them was a
curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor   there was an old
hair trunk in one corner  and a guitar-box in another  and all sorts of
little knickknacks and jimcracks around  like girls brisken up a room
with   the king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
these fixings  and so don't disturb them   the duke's room was pretty
small  but plenty good enough  and so was my cubby 

that night they had a big supper  and all them men and women was there 
and i stood behind the king and the duke's chairs and waited on them  and
the niggers waited on the rest   mary jane she set at the head of the
table  with susan alongside of her  and said how bad the biscuits was 
and how mean the preserves was  and how ornery and tough the fried
chickens was and all that kind of rot  the way women always do for to
force out compliments  and the people all knowed everything was tiptop 
and said so said  how do you get biscuits to brown so nice   and  where 
for the land's sake  did you get these amaz'n pickles   and all that kind
of humbug talky-talk  just the way people always does at a supper  you
know 

and when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen
off of the leavings  whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
the things   the hare-lip she got to pumping me about england  and blest
if i didn't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes   she says 

 did you ever see the king  

 who   william fourth   well  i bet i have he goes to our church    i
knowed he was dead years ago  but i never let on   so when i says he goes
to our church  she says 

 what regular  

 yes regular   his pew's right over opposite ourn on t'other side the
pulpit  

 i thought he lived in london  

 well  he does   where would he live  

 but i thought you lived in sheffield  

i see i was up a stump   i had to let on to get choked with a chicken
bone  so as to get time to think how to get down again   then i says 

 i mean he goes to our church regular when he's in sheffield   that's
only in the summer time  when he comes there to take the sea baths  

 why  how you talk sheffield ain't on the sea  

 well  who said it was  

 why  you did  

 i didn't nuther  

 you did! 

 i didn't  

 you did  

 i never said nothing of the kind  

 well  what did you say  then  

 said he come to take the sea baths that's what i said  

 well  then  how's he going to take the sea baths if it ain't on the
sea  

 looky here   i says   did you ever see any congress-water  

 yes  

 well  did you have to go to congress to get it  

 why  no  

 well  neither does william fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
bath  

 how does he get it  then  

 gets it the way people down here gets congress-water in barrels   there
in the palace at sheffield they've got furnaces  and he wants his water
hot   they can't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea 
they haven't got no conveniences for it  

 oh  i see  now   you might a said that in the first place and saved
time  

when she said that i see i was out of the woods again  and so i was
comfortable and glad   next  she says 

 do you go to church  too  

 yes regular  

 where do you set  

 why  in our pew  

 whose pew  

 why  ourn your uncle harvey's  

 his'n   what does he want with a pew  

 wants it to set in   what did you reckon he wanted with it  

 why  i thought he'd be in the pulpit  

rot him  i forgot he was a preacher   i see i was up a stump again  so i
played another chicken bone and got another think   then i says 

 blame it  do you suppose there ain't but one preacher to a church  

 why  what do they want with more  

 what! to preach before a king   i never did see such a girl as you 
they don't have no less than seventeen  

 seventeen!  my land!  why  i wouldn't set out such a string as that  not
if i never got to glory   it must take 'em a week  

 shucks  they don't all of 'em preach the same day only one of 'em  

 well  then  what does the rest of 'em do  

 oh  nothing much   loll around  pass the plate and one thing or
another   but mainly they don't do nothing  

 well  then  what are they for  

 why  they're for style   don't you know nothing  

 well  i don't want to know no such foolishness as that   how is servants
treated in england   do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers  

 no!  a servant ain't nobody there   they treat them worse than dogs  

 don't they give 'em holidays  the way we do  christmas and new year's
week  and fourth of july  

 oh  just listen!  a body could tell you hain't ever been to england by
that   why  hare-l why  joanna  they never see a holiday from year's end
to year's end  never go to the circus  nor theater  nor nigger shows  nor
nowheres  

 nor church  

 nor church  

 but you always went to church  

well  i was gone up again   i forgot i was the old man's servant   but
next minute i whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
different from a common servant and had to go to church whether he wanted
to or not  and set with the family  on account of its being the law   but
i didn't do it pretty good  and when i got done i see she warn't
satisfied   she says 

 honest injun  now  hain't you been telling me a lot of lies  

 honest injun   says i 

 none of it at all  

 none of it at all   not a lie in it   says i 

 lay your hand on this book and say it  

i see it warn't nothing but a dictionary  so i laid my hand on it and
said it   so then she looked a little better satisfied  and says 

 well  then  i'll believe some of it  but i hope to gracious if i'll
believe the rest  

 what is it you won't believe  joe   says mary jane  stepping in with
susan behind her    it ain't right nor kind for you to talk so to him 
and him a stranger and so far from his people   how would you like to be
treated so  

 that's always your way  maim always sailing in to help somebody before
they're hurt   i hain't done nothing to him   he's told some stretchers 
i reckon  and i said i wouldn't swallow it all  and that's every bit and
grain i did say   i reckon he can stand a little thing like that  can't
he  

 i don't care whether 'twas little or whether 'twas big  he's here in our
house and a stranger  and it wasn't good of you to say it   if you was in
his place it would make you feel ashamed  and so you oughtn't to say a
thing to another person that will make them feel ashamed  

 why  maim  he said  

 it don't make no difference what he said that ain't the thing   the
thing is for you to treat him kind  and not be saying things to make him
remember he ain't in his own country and amongst his own folks  

i says to myself  this is a girl that i'm letting that old reptle rob her
of her money!

then susan she waltzed in  and if you'll believe me  she did give
hare-lip hark from the tomb!

says i to myself  and this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of
her money!

then mary jane she took another inning  and went in sweet and lovely
again which was her way  but when she got done there warn't hardly
anything left o' poor hare-lip   so she hollered 

 all right  then   says the other girls   you just ask his pardon  

she done it  too  and she done it beautiful   she done it so beautiful it
was good to hear  and i wished i could tell her a thousand lies  so she
could do it again 

i says to myself  this is another one that i'm letting him rob her of her
money   and when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to
make me feel at home and know i was amongst friends   i felt so ornery
and low down and mean that i says to myself  my mind's made up  i'll hive
that money for them or bust 

so then i lit out for bed  i said  meaning some time or another   when i
got by myself i went to thinking the thing over   i says to myself  shall
i go to that doctor  private  and blow on these frauds   no that won't
do  he might tell who told him  then the king and the duke would make it
warm for me   shall i go  private  and tell mary jane   no i dasn't do
it  her face would give them a hint  sure  they've got the money  and
they'd slide right out and get away with it   if she was to fetch in help
i'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with  i judge   no 
there ain't no good way but one   i got to steal that money  somehow  and
i got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion that i done it 
they've got a good thing here  and they ain't a-going to leave till
they've played this family and this town for all they're worth  so i'll
find a chance time enough  i'll steal it and hide it  and by and by  when
i'm away down the river  i'll write a letter and tell mary jane where
it's hid   but i better hive it tonight if i can  because the doctor
maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has  he might scare them out
of here yet 

so  thinks i  i'll go and search them rooms   upstairs the hall was dark 
but i found the duke's room  and started to paw around it with my hands 
but i recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let anybody else
take care of that money but his own self  so then i went to his room and
begun to paw around there   but i see i couldn't do nothing without a
candle  and i dasn't light one  of course   so i judged i'd got to do the
other thing lay for them and eavesdrop   about that time i hears their
footsteps coming  and was going to skip under the bed  i reached for it 
but it wasn't where i thought it would be  but i touched the curtain that
hid mary jane's frocks  so i jumped in behind that and snuggled in
amongst the gowns  and stood there perfectly still 

they come in and shut the door  and the first thing the duke done was to
get down and look under the bed   then i was glad i hadn't found the bed
when i wanted it   and yet  you know  it's kind of natural to hide under
the bed when you are up to anything private   they sets down then  and
the king says 

 well  what is it   and cut it middlin' short  because it's better for us
to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a
chance to talk us over  

 well  this is it  capet   i ain't easy  i ain't comfortable   that
doctor lays on my mind   i wanted to know your plans   i've got a notion 
and i think it's a sound one  

 what is it  duke  

 that we better glide out of this before three in the morning  and clip
it down the river with what we've got   specially  seeing we got it so
easy given back to us  flung at our heads  as you may say  when of
course we allowed to have to steal it back   i'm for knocking off and
lighting out  

that made me feel pretty bad   about an hour or two ago it would a been a
little different  but now it made me feel bad and disappointed  the king
rips out and says 

 what!  and not sell out the rest o' the property   march off like a
passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous'n' dollars' worth o'
property layin' around jest sufferin' to be scooped in  and all good 
salable stuff  too  

the duke he grumbled  said the bag of gold was enough  and he didn't want
to go no deeper didn't want to rob a lot of orphans of everything they
had 

 why  how you talk!  says the king    we sha'n't rob 'em of nothing at
all but jest this money   the people that buys the property is the
suff'rers  because as soon 's it's found out 'at we didn't own it which
won't be long after we've slid the sale won't be valid  and it 'll all
go back to the estate   these yer orphans 'll git their house back agin 
and that's enough for them  they're young and spry  and k'n easy earn a
livin'   they ain't a-goin to suffer   why  jest think there's thous'n's
and thous'n's that ain't nigh so well off   bless you  they ain't got
noth'n' to complain of  

well  the king he talked him blind  so at last he give in  and said all
right  but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay  and that
doctor hanging over them   but the king says 

 cuss the doctor!  what do we k'yer for him   hain't we got all the fools
in town on our side   and ain't that a big enough majority in any town  

so they got ready to go down stairs again   the duke says 

 i don't think we put that money in a good place  

that cheered me up   i'd begun to think i warn't going to get a hint of
no kind to help me   the king says 

 why  

 because mary jane 'll be in mourning from this out  and first you know
the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up
and put 'em away  and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not
borrow some of it  

 your head's level agin  duke   says the king  and he comes a-fumbling
under the curtain two or three foot from where i was   i stuck tight to
the wall and kept mighty still  though quivery  and i wondered what them
fellows would say to me if they catched me  and i tried to think what i'd
better do if they did catch me   but the king he got the bag before i
could think more than about a half a thought  and he never suspicioned i
was around   they took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick
that was under the feather-bed  and crammed it in a foot or two amongst
the straw and said it was all right now  because a nigger only makes up
the feather-bed  and don't turn over the straw tick only about twice a
year  and so it warn't in no danger of getting stole now 

but i knowed better   i had it out of there before they was half-way down
stairs   i groped along up to my cubby  and hid it there till i could get
a chance to do better   i judged i better hide it outside of the house
somewheres  because if they missed it they would give the house a good
ransacking   i knowed that very well   then i turned in  with my clothes
all on  but i couldn't a gone to sleep if i'd a wanted to  i was in such
a sweat to get through with the business   by and by i heard the king and
the duke come up  so i rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the
top of my ladder  and waited to see if anything was going to happen   but
nothing did 

so i held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadn't
begun yet  and then i slipped down the ladder 




i crept to their doors and listened  they was snoring   so i tiptoed
along  and got down stairs all right   there warn't a sound anywheres   i
peeped through a crack of the dining-room door  and see the men that was
watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs   the door was open
into the parlor  where the corpse was laying  and there was a candle in
both rooms  i passed along  and the parlor door was open  but i see there
warn't nobody in there but the remainders of peter  so i shoved on by 
but the front door was locked  and the key wasn't there   just then i
heard somebody coming down the stairs  back behind me   i run in the
parlor and took a swift look around  and the only place i see to hide the
bag was in the coffin   the lid was shoved along about a foot  showing
the dead man's face down in there  with a wet cloth over it  and his
shroud on   i tucked the money-bag in under the lid  just down beyond
where his hands was crossed  which made me creep  they was so cold  and
then i run back across the room and in behind the door 

the person coming was mary jane   she went to the coffin  very soft  and
kneeled down and looked in  then she put up her handkerchief  and i see
she begun to cry  though i couldn't hear her  and her back was to me   i
slid out  and as i passed the dining-room i thought i'd make sure them
watchers hadn't seen me  so i looked through the crack  and everything
was all right   they hadn't stirred 

i slipped up to bed  feeling ruther blue  on accounts of the thing
playing out that way after i had took so much trouble and run so much
resk about it   says i  if it could stay where it is  all right  because
when we get down the river a hundred mile or two i could write back to
mary jane  and she could dig him up again and get it  but that ain't the
thing that's going to happen  the thing that's going to happen is  the
money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid   then the king 'll
get it again  and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another
chance to smouch it from him  of course i wanted to slide down and get it
out of there  but i dasn't try it   every minute it was getting earlier
now  and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir  and i
might get catched catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that
nobody hadn't hired me to take care of   i don't wish to be mixed up in
no such business as that  i says to myself 

when i got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up  and the
watchers was gone   there warn't nobody around but the family and the
widow bartley and our tribe   i watched their faces to see if anything
had been happening  but i couldn't tell 

towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man  and they
set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs  and then
set all our chairs in rows  and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full   i see the coffin lid
was the way it was before  but i dasn't go to look in under it  with
folks around 

then the people begun to flock in  and the beats and the girls took seats
in the front row at the head of the coffin  and for a half an hour the
people filed around slow  in single rank  and looked down at the dead
man's face a minute  and some dropped in a tear  and it was all very
still and solemn  only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to
their eyes and keeping their heads bent  and sobbing a little   there
warn't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
blowing noses because people always blows them more at a funeral than
they do at other places except church 

when the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
gloves with his softy soothering ways  putting on the last touches  and
getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable  and making no
more sound than a cat   he never spoke  he moved people around  he
squeezed in late ones  he opened up passageways  and done it with nods 
and signs with his hands   then he took his place over against the wall 
he was the softest  glidingest  stealthiest man i ever see  and there
warn't no more smile to him than there is to a ham 

they had borrowed a melodeum a sick one  and when everything was ready a
young woman set down and worked it  and it was pretty skreeky and
colicky  and everybody joined in and sung  and peter was the only one
that had a good thing  according to my notion   then the reverend hobson
opened up  slow and solemn  and begun to talk  and straight off the most
outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard  it was only
one dog  but he made a most powerful racket  and he kept it up right
along  the parson he had to stand there  over the coffin  and wait you
couldn't hear yourself think   it was right down awkward  and nobody
didn't seem to know what to do   but pretty soon they see that
long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say 
 don't you worry just depend on me    then he stooped down and begun to
glide along the wall  just his shoulders showing over the people's heads 
so he glided along  and the powwow and racket getting more and more
outrageous all the time  and at last  when he had gone around two sides
of the room  he disappears down cellar   then in about two seconds we
heard a whack  and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
two  and then everything was dead still  and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off   in a minute or two here comes this undertaker's
back and shoulders gliding along the wall again  and so he glided and
glided around three sides of the room  and then rose up  and shaded his
mouth with his hands  and stretched his neck out towards the preacher 
over the people's heads  and says  in a kind of a coarse whisper   he had
a rat!   then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his
place   you could see it was a great satisfaction to the people  because
naturally they wanted to know   a little thing like that don't cost
nothing  and it's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up
to and liked   there warn't no more popular man in town than what that
undertaker was 

well  the funeral sermon was very good  but pison long and tiresome  and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage  and at
last the job was through  and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
coffin with his screw-driver   i was in a sweat then  and watched him
pretty keen  but he never meddled at all  just slid the lid along as soft
as mush  and screwed it down tight and fast   so there i was!  i didn't
know whether the money was in there or not   so  says i  s'pose somebody
has hogged that bag on the sly  now how do i know whether to write to
mary jane or not  s'pose she dug him up and didn't find nothing  what
would she think of me  blame it  i says  i might get hunted up and
jailed  i'd better lay low and keep dark  and not write at all  the
thing's awful mixed now  trying to better it  i've worsened it a hundred
times  and i wish to goodness i'd just let it alone  dad fetch the whole
business!

they buried him  and we come back home  and i went to watching faces
again i couldn't help it  and i couldn't rest easy   but nothing come
of it  the faces didn't tell me nothing 

the king he visited around in the evening  and sweetened everybody up 
and made himself ever so friendly  and he give out the idea that his
congregation over in england would be in a sweat about him  so he must
hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home   he was
very sorry he was so pushed  and so was everybody  they wished he could
stay longer  but they said they could see it couldn't be done   and he
said of course him and william would take the girls home with them  and
that pleased everybody too  because then the girls would be well fixed
and amongst their own relations  and it pleased the girls  too tickled
them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world  and told
him to sell out as quick as he wanted to  they would be ready   them poor
things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting
fooled and lied to so  but i didn't see no safe way for me to chip in and
change the general tune 

well  blamed if the king didn't bill the house and the niggers and all
the property for auction straight off sale two days after the funeral 
but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to 

so the next day after the funeral  along about noon-time  the girls' joy
got the first jolt   a couple of nigger traders come along  and the king
sold them the niggers reasonable  for three-day drafts as they called it 
and away they went  the two sons up the river to memphis  and their
mother down the river to orleans   i thought them poor girls and them
niggers would break their hearts for grief  they cried around each other 
and took on so it most made me down sick to see it   the girls said they
hadn't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the
town   i can't ever get it out of my memory  the sight of them poor
miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other's necks and crying 
and i reckon i couldn't a stood it all  but would a had to bust out and
tell on our gang if i hadn't knowed the sale warn't no account and the
niggers would be back home in a week or two 

the thing made a big stir in the town  too  and a good many come out
flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
children that way   it injured the frauds some  but the old fool he
bulled right along  spite of all the duke could say or do  and i tell you
the duke was powerful uneasy 

next day was auction day   about broad day in the morning the king and
the duke come up in the garret and woke me up  and i see by their look
that there was trouble   the king says 

 was you in my room night before last  

 no  your majesty  which was the way i always called him when nobody but
our gang warn't around 

 was you in there yisterday er last night  

 no  your majesty  

 honor bright  now no lies  

 honor bright  your majesty  i'm telling you the truth   i hain't been
a-near your room since miss mary jane took you and the duke and showed it
to you  

the duke says 

 have you seen anybody else go in there  

 no  your grace  not as i remember  i believe  

 stop and think  

i studied awhile and see my chance  then i says 

 well  i see the niggers go in there several times  

both of them gave a little jump  and looked like they hadn't ever
expected it  and then like they had   then the duke says 

 what  all of them  

 no leastways  not all at once that is  i don't think i ever see them
all come out at once but just one time  

 hello!  when was that  

 it was the day we had the funeral   in the morning   it warn't early 
because i overslept   i was just starting down the ladder  and i see
them  

 well  go on  go on!  what did they do   how'd they act  

 they didn't do nothing   and they didn't act anyway much  as fur as i
see  they tiptoed away  so i seen  easy enough  that they'd shoved in
there to do up your majesty's room  or something  s'posing you was up 
and found you warn't up  and so they was hoping to slide out of the way
of trouble without waking you up  if they hadn't already waked you up  

 great guns  this is a go!  says the king  and both of them looked pretty
sick and tolerable silly   they stood there a-thinking and scratching
their heads a minute  and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy
chuckle  and says 

 it does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand   they let on to
be sorry they was going out of this region!  and i believed they was
sorry  and so did you  and so did everybody   don't ever tell me any more
that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent   why  the way they played
that thing it would fool anybody   in my opinion  there's a fortune in
'em   if i had capital and a theater  i wouldn't want a better lay-out
than that and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song   yes  and ain't
privileged to sing the song yet   say  where is that song that draft  

 in the bank for to be collected   where would it be  

 well  that's all right then  thank goodness  

says i  kind of timid-like 

 is something gone wrong  

the king whirls on me and rips out 

 none o' your business!  you keep your head shet  and mind y'r own
affairs if you got any   long as you're in this town don't you forgit
that you hear    then he says to the duke   we got to jest swaller it
and say noth'n'   mum's the word for us  

as they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again  and
says 

 quick sales and small profits!  it's a good business yes  

the king snarls around on him and says 

 i was trying to do for the best in sellin' 'em out so quick   if the
profits has turned out to be none  lackin' considable  and none to carry 
is it my fault any more'n it's yourn  

 well  they'd be in this house yet and we wouldn't if i could a got my
advice listened to  

the king sassed back as much as was safe for him  and then swapped around
and lit into me again   he give me down the banks for not coming and
telling him i see the niggers come out of his room acting that way said
any fool would a knowed something was up   and then waltzed in and cussed
himself awhile  and said it all come of him not laying late and taking
his natural rest that morning  and he'd be blamed if he'd ever do it
again   so they went off a-jawing  and i felt dreadful glad i'd worked it
all off on to the niggers  and yet hadn't done the niggers no harm by it 




by and by it was getting-up time   so i come down the ladder and started
for down-stairs  but as i come to the girls' room the door was open  and
i see mary jane setting by her old hair trunk  which was open and she'd
been packing things in it getting ready to go to england   but she had
stopped now with a folded gown in her lap  and had her face in her hands 
crying   i felt awful bad to see it  of course anybody would   i went in
there and says 

 miss mary jane  you can't a-bear to see people in trouble  and i can't
 most always   tell me about it  

so she done it   and it was the niggers i just expected it   she said
the beautiful trip to england was most about spoiled for her  she didn't
know how she was ever going to be happy there  knowing the mother and the
children warn't ever going to see each other no more and then busted out
bitterer than ever  and flung up her hands  and says 

 oh  dear  dear  to think they ain't ever going to see each other any
more! 

 but they will and inside of two weeks and i know it!  says i 

laws  it was out before i could think!  and before i could budge she
throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it again  say it again 
say it again!

i see i had spoke too sudden and said too much  and was in a close place 
i asked her to let me think a minute  and she set there  very impatient
and excited and handsome  but looking kind of happy and eased-up  like a
person that's had a tooth pulled out   so i went to studying it out   i
says to myself  i reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is
in a tight place is taking considerable many resks  though i ain't had no
experience  and can't say for certain  but it looks so to me  anyway  and
yet here's a case where i'm blest if it don't look to me like the truth
is better and actuly safer than a lie   i must lay it by in my mind  and
think it over some time or other  it's so kind of strange and unregular 
i never see nothing like it   well  i says to myself at last  i'm a-going
to chance it  i'll up and tell the truth this time  though it does seem
most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see
where you'll go to  then i says 

 miss mary jane  is there any place out of town a little ways where you
could go and stay three or four days  

 yes  mr  lothrop's   why  

 never mind why yet   if i'll tell you how i know the niggers will see
each other again inside of two weeks here in this house and prove how i
know it will you go to mr  lothrop's and stay four days  

 four days!  she says   i'll stay a year! 

 all right   i says   i don't want nothing more out of you than just your
word i druther have it than another man's kiss-the-bible    she smiled
and reddened up very sweet  and i says   if you don't mind it  i'll shut
the door and bolt it  

then i come back and set down again  and says 

 don't you holler   just set still and take it like a man   i got to tell
the truth  and you want to brace up  miss mary  because it's a bad kind 
and going to be hard to take  but there ain't no help for it   these
uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all  they're a couple of frauds
 regular dead-beats   there  now we're over the worst of it  you can stand
the rest middling easy  

it jolted her up like everything  of course  but i was over the shoal
water now  so i went right along  her eyes a-blazing higher and higher
all the time  and told her every blame thing  from where we first struck
that young fool going up to the steamboat  clear through to where she
flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed her
sixteen or seventeen times and then up she jumps  with her face afire
like sunset  and says 

 the brute!  come  don't waste a minute not a second we'll have them
tarred and feathered  and flung in the river! 

says i 

 cert'nly   but do you mean before you go to mr  lothrop's  or  

 oh   she says   what am i thinking about!  she says  and set right down
again    don't mind what i said please don't you won't  now  will you  
laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that i said i would
die first    i never thought  i was so stirred up   she says   now go on 
and i won't do so any more   you tell me what to do  and whatever you say
i'll do it  

 well   i says   it's a rough gang  them two frauds  and i'm fixed so i
got to travel with them a while longer  whether i want to or not i
druther not tell you why  and if you was to blow on them this town would
get me out of their claws  and i'd be all right  but there'd be another
person that you don't know about who'd be in big trouble   well  we got
to save him  hain't we   of course   well  then  we won't blow on them  

saying them words put a good idea in my head   i see how maybe i could
get me and jim rid of the frauds  get them jailed here  and then leave 
but i didn't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
to answer questions but me  so i didn't want the plan to begin working
till pretty late to-night   i says 

 miss mary jane  i'll tell you what we'll do  and you won't have to stay
at mr  lothrop's so long  nuther   how fur is it  

 a little short of four miles right out in the country  back here  

 well  that 'll answer   now you go along out there  and lay low till
nine or half-past to-night  and then get them to fetch you home again
 tell them you've thought of something   if you get here before eleven put
a candle in this window  and if i don't turn up wait till eleven  and
then if i don't turn up it means i'm gone  and out of the way  and safe 
then you come out and spread the news around  and get these beats
jailed  

 good   she says   i'll do it  

 and if it just happens so that i don't get away  but get took up along
with them  you must up and say i told you the whole thing beforehand  and
you must stand by me all you can  

 stand by you! indeed i will   they sha'n't touch a hair of your head! 
she says  and i see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
it  too 

 if i get away i sha'n't be here   i says   to prove these rapscallions
ain't your uncles  and i couldn't do it if i was here   i could swear
they was beats and bummers  that's all  though that's worth something 
well  there's others can do that better than what i can  and they're
people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as i'd be   i'll tell you
how to find them   gimme a pencil and a piece of paper   there 'royal
nonesuch  bricksville '  put it away  and don't lose it   when the court
wants to find out something about these two  let them send up to
bricksville and say they've got the men that played the royal nonesuch 
and ask for some witnesses why  you'll have that entire town down here
before you can hardly wink  miss mary   and they'll come a-biling  too  

i judged we had got everything fixed about right now   so i says 

 just let the auction go right along  and don't worry   nobody don't have
to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on
accounts of the short notice  and they ain't going out of this till they
get that money  and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count 
and they ain't going to get no money   it's just like the way it was with
the niggers it warn't no sale  and the niggers will be back before
long   why  they can't collect the money for the niggers yet they're in
the worst kind of a fix  miss mary  

 well   she says   i'll run down to breakfast now  and then i'll start
straight for mr  lothrop's  

 'deed  that ain't the ticket  miss mary jane   i says   by no manner of
means  go before breakfast  

 why  

 what did you reckon i wanted you to go at all for  miss mary  

 well  i never thought and come to think  i don't know   what was it  

 why  it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people   i don't
want no better book than what your face is   a body can set down and read
it off like coarse print   do you reckon you can go and face your uncles
when they come to kiss you good-morning  and never  

 there  there  don't!  yes  i'll go before breakfast i'll be glad to 
and leave my sisters with them  

 yes  never mind about them   they've got to stand it yet a while   they
might suspicion something if all of you was to go   i don't want you to
see them  nor your sisters  nor nobody in this town  if a neighbor was to
ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something   no 
you go right along  miss mary jane  and i'll fix it with all of them 
i'll tell miss susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went
away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change  or to see a
friend  and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning  

 gone to see a friend is all right  but i won't have my love given to
them  

 well  then  it sha'n't be    it was well enough to tell her so no harm
in it   it was only a little thing to do  and no trouble  and it's the
little things that smooths people's roads the most  down here below  it
would make mary jane comfortable  and it wouldn't cost nothing   then i
says    there's one more thing that bag of money  

 well  they've got that  and it makes me feel pretty silly to think how
they got it  

 no  you're out  there   they hain't got it  

 why  who's got it  

 i wish i knowed  but i don't   i had it  because i stole it from them 
and i stole it to give to you  and i know where i hid it  but i'm afraid
it ain't there no more   i'm awful sorry  miss mary jane  i'm just as
sorry as i can be  but i done the best i could  i did honest   i come
nigh getting caught  and i had to shove it into the first place i come
to  and run and it warn't a good place  

 oh  stop blaming yourself it's too bad to do it  and i won't allow it
 you couldn't help it  it wasn't your fault   where did you hide it  

i didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again  and i
couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach   so
for a minute i didn't say nothing  then i says 

 i'd ruther not tell you where i put it  miss mary jane  if you don't
mind letting me off  but i'll write it for you on a piece of paper  and
you can read it along the road to mr  lothrop's  if you want to   do you
reckon that 'll do  

 oh  yes  

so i wrote    i put it in the coffin   it was in there when you was
crying there  away in the night   i was behind the door  and i was mighty
sorry for you  miss mary jane  

it made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
herself in the night  and them devils laying there right under her own
roof  shaming her and robbing her  and when i folded it up and give it to
her i see the water come into her eyes  too  and she shook me by the
hand  hard  and says 

 good-bye   i'm going to do everything just as you've told me  and if i
don't ever see you again  i sha'n't ever forget you and i'll think of
you a many and a many a time  and i'll pray for you  too!  and she was
gone 

pray for me!  i reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more
nearer her size   but i bet she done it  just the same she was just that
kind   she had the grit to pray for judus if she took the notion there
warn't no back-down to her  i judge   you may say what you want to  but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl i ever see  in my
opinion she was just full of sand   it sounds like flattery  but it ain't
no flattery   and when it comes to beauty and goodness  too she lays
over them all   i hain't ever seen her since that time that i see her go
out of that door  no  i hain't ever seen her since  but i reckon i've
thought of her a many and a many a million times  and of her saying she
would pray for me  and if ever i'd a thought it would do any good for me
to pray for her  blamed if i wouldn't a done it or bust 

well  mary jane she lit out the back way  i reckon  because nobody see
her go   when i struck susan and the hare-lip  i says 

 what's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that
you all goes to see sometimes  

they says 

 there's several  but it's the proctors  mainly  

 that's the name   i says   i most forgot it   well  miss mary jane she
told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry one of
them's sick  

 which one  

 i don't know  leastways  i kinder forget  but i thinks it's  

 sakes alive  i hope it ain't hanner  

 i'm sorry to say it   i says   but hanner's the very one  

 my goodness  and she so well only last week!  is she took bad  

 it ain't no name for it   they set up with her all night  miss mary jane
said  and they don't think she'll last many hours  

 only think of that  now!  what's the matter with her  

i couldn't think of anything reasonable  right off that way  so i says 

 mumps  

 mumps your granny!  they don't set up with people that's got the mumps  

 they don't  don't they   you better bet they do with these mumps   these
mumps is different   it's a new kind  miss mary jane said  

 how's it a new kind  

 because it's mixed up with other things  

 what other things  

 well  measles  and whooping-cough  and erysiplas  and consumption  and
yaller janders  and brain-fever  and i don't know what all  

 my land!  and they call it the mumps  

 that's what miss mary jane said  

 well  what in the nation do they call it the mumps for  

 why  because it is the mumps   that's what it starts with  

 well  ther' ain't no sense in it   a body might stump his toe  and take
pison  and fall down the well  and break his neck  and bust his brains
out  and somebody come along and ask what killed him  and some numskull
up and say  'why  he stumped his toe '  would ther' be any sense in that 
no   and ther' ain't no sense in this  nuther   is it ketching  

 is it ketching   why  how you talk   is a harrow catching in the dark 
if you don't hitch on to one tooth  you're bound to on another  ain't
you  and you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole
harrow along  can you   well  these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow 
as you may say and it ain't no slouch of a harrow  nuther  you come to
get it hitched on good  

 well  it's awful  i think   says the hare-lip    i'll go to uncle harvey
and  

 oh  yes   i says   i would   of course i would   i wouldn't lose no
time  

 well  why wouldn't you  

 just look at it a minute  and maybe you can see   hain't your uncles
obleegd to get along home to england as fast as they can   and do you
reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
journey by yourselves   you know they'll wait for you   so fur  so good 
your uncle harvey's a preacher  ain't he   very well  then  is a preacher
going to deceive a steamboat clerk  is he going to deceive a ship clerk 
 so as to get them to let miss mary jane go aboard   now you know he
ain't   what will he do  then   why  he'll say  'it's a great pity  but
my church matters has got to get along the best way they can  for my
niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps  and so it's
my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to
show on her if she's got it '  but never mind  if you think it's best to
tell your uncle harvey  

 shucks  and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
times in england whilst we was waiting to find out whether mary jane's
got it or not   why  you talk like a muggins  

 well  anyway  maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors  

 listen at that  now   you do beat all for natural stupidness   can't you
see that they'd go and tell   ther' ain't no way but just to not tell
anybody at all  

 well  maybe you're right yes  i judge you are right  

 but i reckon we ought to tell uncle harvey she's gone out a while 
anyway  so he won't be uneasy about her  

 yes  miss mary jane she wanted you to do that   she says  'tell them to
give uncle harvey and william my love and a kiss  and say i've run over
the river to see mr ' mr  what is the name of that rich family your
uncle peter used to think so much of  i mean the one that  

 why  you must mean the apthorps  ain't it  

 of course  bother them kind of names  a body can't ever seem to remember
them  half the time  somehow   yes  she said  say she has run over for to
ask the apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house 
because she allowed her uncle peter would ruther they had it than anybody
else  and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come  and
then  if she ain't too tired  she's coming home  and if she is  she'll be
home in the morning anyway   she said  don't say nothing about the
proctors  but only about the apthorps which 'll be perfectly true 
because she is going there to speak about their buying the house  i know
it  because she told me so herself  

 all right   they said  and cleared out to lay for their uncles  and give
them the love and the kisses  and tell them the message 

everything was all right now   the girls wouldn't say nothing because
they wanted to go to england  and the king and the duke would ruther mary
jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of doctor
robinson   i felt very good  i judged i had done it pretty neat i
reckoned tom sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself   of course he
would a throwed more style into it  but i can't do that very handy  not
being brung up to it 

well  they held the auction in the public square  along towards the end
of the afternoon  and it strung along  and strung along  and the old man
he was on hand and looking his level pisonest  up there longside of the
auctioneer  and chipping in a little scripture now and then  or a little
goody-goody saying of some kind  and the duke he was around goo-gooing
for sympathy all he knowed how  and just spreading himself generly 

but by and by the thing dragged through  and everything was sold
 everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard   so they'd got
to work that off i never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting
to swallow everything   well  whilst they was at it a steamboat landed 
and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and
laughing and carrying on  and singing out 

 here's your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old peter
wilks and you pays your money and you takes your choice! 




they was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along  and a
nice-looking younger one  with his right arm in a sling   and  my souls 
how the people yelled and laughed  and kept it up   but i didn't see no
joke about it  and i judged it would strain the duke and the king some to
see any   i reckoned they'd turn pale   but no  nary a pale did they
turn  the duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up  but just went
a goo-gooing around  happy and satisfied  like a jug that's googling out
buttermilk  and as for the king  he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful
on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to
think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world   oh  he done
it admirable   lots of the principal people gethered around the king  to
let him see they was on his side   that old gentleman that had just come
looked all puzzled to death   pretty soon he begun to speak  and i see
straight off he pronounced like an englishman not the king's way  though
the king's was pretty good for an imitation   i can't give the old gent's
words  nor i can't imitate him  but he turned around to the crowd  and
says  about like this 

 this is a surprise to me which i wasn't looking for  and i'll
acknowledge  candid and frank  i ain't very well fixed to meet it and
answer it  for my brother and me has had misfortunes  he's broke his arm 
and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night
by a mistake   i am peter wilks' brother harvey  and this is his brother
william  which can't hear nor speak and can't even make signs to amount
to much  now't he's only got one hand to work them with   we are who we
say we are  and in a day or two  when i get the baggage  i can prove it 
but up till then i won't say nothing more  but go to the hotel and wait  

so him and the new dummy started off  and the king he laughs  and
blethers out 

 broke his arm very likely  ain't it  and very convenient  too  for a
fraud that's got to make signs  and ain't learnt how   lost their
baggage! that's mighty good! and mighty ingenious under the
circumstances! 

so he laughed again  and so did everybody else  except three or four  or
maybe half a dozen   one of these was that doctor  another one was a
sharp-looking gentleman  with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made
out of carpet-stuff  that had just come off of the steamboat and was
talking to him in a low voice  and glancing towards the king now and then
and nodding their heads it was levi bell  the lawyer that was gone up to
louisville  and another one was a big rough husky that come along and
listened to all the old gentleman said  and was listening to the king
now  and when the king got done this husky up and says 

 say  looky here  if you are harvey wilks  when'd you come to this town  

 the day before the funeral  friend   says the king 

 but what time o' day  

 in the evenin' 'bout an hour er two before sundown  

 how'd you come  

 i come down on the susan powell from cincinnati  

 well  then  how'd you come to be up at the pint in the mornin' in a
canoe  

 i warn't up at the pint in the mornin'  

 it's a lie  

several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
old man and a preacher 

 preacher be hanged  he's a fraud and a liar   he was up at the pint that
mornin'   i live up there  don't i   well  i was up there  and he was up
there   i see him there   he come in a canoe  along with tim collins and
a boy  

the doctor he up and says 

 would you know the boy again if you was to see him  hines  

 i reckon i would  but i don't know   why  yonder he is  now   i know him
perfectly easy  

it was me he pointed at   the doctor says 

 neighbors  i don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not  but if
these two ain't frauds  i am an idiot  that's all   i think it's our duty
to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this
thing  come along  hines  come along  the rest of you   we'll take these
fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple  and i reckon
we'll find out something before we get through  

it was nuts for the crowd  though maybe not for the king's friends  so we
all started   it was about sundown   the doctor he led me along by the
hand  and was plenty kind enough  but he never let go my hand 

we all got in a big room in the hotel  and lit up some candles  and
fetched in the new couple   first  the doctor says 

 i don't wish to be too hard on these two men  but i think they're
frauds  and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about   if
they have  won't the complices get away with that bag of gold peter wilks
left   it ain't unlikely   if these men ain't frauds  they won't object
to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're
all right ain't that so  

everybody agreed to that   so i judged they had our gang in a pretty
tight place right at the outstart   but the king he only looked
sorrowful  and says 

 gentlemen  i wish the money was there  for i ain't got no disposition to
throw anything in the way of a fair  open  out-and-out investigation o'
this misable business  but  alas  the money ain't there  you k'n send and
see  if you want to  

 where is it  then  

 well  when my niece give it to me to keep for her i took and hid it
inside o' the straw tick o' my bed  not wishin' to bank it for the few
days we'd be here  and considerin' the bed a safe place  we not bein'
used to niggers  and suppos'n' 'em honest  like servants in england   the
niggers stole it the very next mornin' after i had went down stairs  and
when i sold 'em i hadn't missed the money yit  so they got clean away
with it   my servant here k'n tell you 'bout it  gentlemen  

the doctor and several said  shucks!  and i see nobody didn't altogether
believe him   one man asked me if i see the niggers steal it   i said no 
but i see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away  and i never
thought nothing  only i reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my
master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them   that
was all they asked me   then the doctor whirls on me and says 

 are you english  too  

i says yes  and him and some others laughed  and said   stuff! 

well  then they sailed in on the general investigation  and there we had
it  up and down  hour in  hour out  and nobody never said a word about
supper  nor ever seemed to think about it and so they kept it up  and
kept it up  and it was the worst mixed-up thing you ever see   they made
the king tell his yarn  and they made the old gentleman tell his'n  and
anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a seen that the old
gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies   and by and by they
had me up to tell what i knowed   the king he give me a left-handed look
out of the corner of his eye  and so i knowed enough to talk on the right
side   i begun to tell about sheffield  and how we lived there  and all
about the english wilkses  and so on  but i didn't get pretty fur till
the doctor begun to laugh  and levi bell  the lawyer  says 

 set down  my boy  i wouldn't strain myself if i was you   i reckon you
ain't used to lying  it don't seem to come handy  what you want is
practice   you do it pretty awkward  

i didn't care nothing for the compliment  but i was glad to be let off 
anyway 

the doctor he started to say something  and turns and says 

 if you'd been in town at first  levi bell   the king broke in and
reached out his hand  and says 

 why  is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often
about  

the lawyer and him shook hands  and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased 
and they talked right along awhile  and then got to one side and talked
low  and at last the lawyer speaks up and says 

 that 'll fix it   i'll take the order and send it  along with your
brother's  and then they'll know it's all right  

so they got some paper and a pen  and the king he set down and twisted
his head to one side  and chawed his tongue  and scrawled off something 
and then they give the pen to the duke and then for the first time the
duke looked sick   but he took the pen and wrote   so then the lawyer
turns to the new old gentleman and says 

 you and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names  

the old gentleman wrote  but nobody couldn't read it   the lawyer looked
powerful astonished  and says 

 well  it beats me  and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket 
and examined them  and then examined the old man's writing  and then them
again  and then says    these old letters is from harvey wilks  and
here's these two handwritings  and anybody can see they didn't write
them  (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish  i tell you  to see
how the lawyer had took them in)   and here's this old gentleman's hand
writing  and anybody can tell  easy enough  he didn't write them fact
is  the scratches he makes ain't properly writing at all   now  here's
some letters from  

the new old gentleman says 

 if you please  let me explain   nobody can read my hand but my brother
there so he copies for me   it's his hand you've got there  not mine  

 well!  says the lawyer   this is a state of things   i've got some of
william's letters  too  so if you'll get him to write a line or so we can
com  

 he can't write with his left hand   says the old gentleman    if he
could use his right hand  you would see that he wrote his own letters and
mine too   look at both  please they're by the same hand  

the lawyer done it  and says 

 i believe it's so and if it ain't so  there's a heap stronger
resemblance than i'd noticed before  anyway   well  well  well!  i
thought we was right on the track of a solution  but it's gone to grass 
partly   but anyway  one thing is proved these two ain't either of 'em
wilkses  and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke 

well  what do you think   that muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in then!
indeed he wouldn't   said it warn't no fair test   said his brother
william was the cussedest joker in the world  and hadn't tried to write
 he see william was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the
pen to paper   and so he warmed up and went warbling right along till he
was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying himself  but pretty
soon the new gentleman broke in  and says 

 i've thought of something   is there anybody here that helped to lay out
my br helped to lay out the late peter wilks for burying  

 yes   says somebody   me and ab turner done it   we're both here  

then the old man turns towards the king  and says 

 perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast  

blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick  or he'd a
squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under  it took him
so sudden  and  mind you  it was a thing that was calculated to make most
anybody sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice 
because how was he going to know what was tattooed on the man   he
whitened a little  he couldn't help it  and it was mighty still in there 
and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him   says i to
myself  now he'll throw up the sponge there ain't no more use   well 
did he   a body can't hardly believe it  but he didn't   i reckon he
thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out  so they'd
thin out  and him and the duke could break loose and get away   anyway 
he set there  and pretty soon he begun to smile  and says 

 mf!  it's a very tough question  ain't it!  yes  sir  i k'n tell you
what's tattooed on his breast   it's jest a small  thin  blue arrow
 that's what it is  and if you don't look clost  you can't see it   now
what do you say hey  

well  i never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out
cheek 

the new old gentleman turns brisk towards ab turner and his pard  and his
eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king this time  and says 

 there you've heard what he said!  was there any such mark on peter
wilks' breast  

both of them spoke up and says 

 we didn't see no such mark  

 good!  says the old gentleman    now  what you did see on his breast was
a small dim p  and a b (which is an initial he dropped when he was
young)  and a w  with dashes between them  so   p b w  and he marked
them that way on a piece of paper    come  ain't that what you saw  

both of them spoke up again  and says 

 no  we didn't   we never seen any marks at all  

well  everybody was in a state of mind now  and they sings out 

 the whole bilin' of 'm 's frauds!  le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's
ride 'em on a rail!  and everybody was whooping at once  and there was a
rattling powwow   but the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells  and
says 

 gentlemen gentlemen!  hear me just a word just a single word if you
please!  there's one way yet let's go and dig up the corpse and look  

that took them 

 hooray!  they all shouted  and was starting right off  but the lawyer
and the doctor sung out 

 hold on  hold on!  collar all these four men and the boy  and fetch them
along  too! 

 we'll do it!  they all shouted   and if we don't find them marks we'll
lynch the whole gang! 

i was scared  now  i tell you   but there warn't no getting away  you
know  they gripped us all  and marched us right along  straight for the
graveyard  which was a mile and a half down the river  and the whole town
at our heels  for we made noise enough  and it was only nine in the
evening 

as we went by our house i wished i hadn't sent mary jane out of town 
because now if i could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me  and
blow on our dead-beats 

well  we swarmed along down the river road  just carrying on like
wildcats  and to make it more scary the sky was darking up  and the
lightning beginning to wink and flitter  and the wind to shiver amongst
the leaves  this was the most awful trouble and most dangersome i ever
was in  and i was kinder stunned  everything was going so different from
what i had allowed for  stead of being fixed so i could take my own time
if i wanted to  and see all the fun  and have mary jane at my back to
save me and set me free when the close-fit come  here was nothing in the
world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks   if they
didn't find them 

i couldn't bear to think about it  and yet  somehow  i couldn't think
about nothing else   it got darker and darker  and it was a beautiful
time to give the crowd the slip  but that big husky had me by the wrist
 hines and a body might as well try to give goliar the slip   he dragged
me right along  he was so excited  and i had to run to keep up 

when they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
like an overflow   and when they got to the grave they found they had
about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted  but nobody hadn't
thought to fetch a lantern   but they sailed into digging anyway by the
flicker of the lightning  and sent a man to the nearest house  a half a
mile off  to borrow one 

so they dug and dug like everything  and it got awful dark  and the rain
started  and the wind swished and swushed along  and the lightning come
brisker and brisker  and the thunder boomed  but them people never took
no notice of it  they was so full of this business  and one minute you
could see everything and every face in that big crowd  and the shovelfuls
of dirt sailing up out of the grave  and the next second the dark wiped
it all out  and you couldn't see nothing at all 

at last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid  and then
such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was  to
scrouge in and get a sight  you never see  and in the dark  that way  it
was awful   hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so  and i
reckon he clean forgot i was in the world  he was so excited and panting 

all of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare  and
somebody sings out 

 by the living jingo  here's the bag of gold on his breast! 

hines let out a whoop  like everybody else  and dropped my wrist and give
a big surge to bust his way in and get a look  and the way i lit out and
shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell 

i had the road all to myself  and i fairly flew leastways  i had it all
to myself except the solid dark  and the now-and-then glares  and the
buzzing of the rain  and the thrashing of the wind  and the splitting of
the thunder  and sure as you are born i did clip it along!

when i struck the town i see there warn't nobody out in the storm  so i
never hunted for no back streets  but humped it straight through the main
one  and when i begun to get towards our house i aimed my eye and set it 
no light there  the house all dark which made me feel sorry and
disappointed  i didn't know why   but at last  just as i was sailing by 
flash comes the light in mary jane's window! and my heart swelled up
sudden  like to bust  and the same second the house and all was behind me
in the dark  and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world 
she was the best girl i ever see  and had the most sand 

the minute i was far enough above the town to see i could make the
towhead  i begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow  and the first time
the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained i snatched it and shoved 
it was a canoe  and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope   the towhead
was a rattling big distance off  away out there in the middle of the
river  but i didn't lose no time  and when i struck the raft at last i
was so fagged i would a just laid down to blow and gasp if i could
afforded it   but i didn't   as i sprung aboard i sung out 

 out with you  jim  and set her loose!  glory be to goodness  we're shut
of them! 

jim lit out  and was a-coming for me with both arms spread  he was so
full of joy  but when i glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in
my mouth and i went overboard backwards  for i forgot he was old king
lear and a drownded a-rab all in one  and it most scared the livers and
lights out of me   but jim fished me out  and was going to hug me and
bless me  and so on  he was so glad i was back and we was shut of the
king and the duke  but i says 

 not now  have it for breakfast  have it for breakfast!  cut loose and
let her slide! 

so in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river  and it did seem
so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river  and
nobody to bother us   i had to skip around a bit  and jump up and crack
my heels a few times i couldn't help it  but about the third crack i
noticed a sound that i knowed mighty well  and held my breath and
listened and waited  and sure enough  when the next flash busted out over
the water  here they come! and just a-laying to their oars and making
their skiff hum!  it was the king and the duke 

so i wilted right down on to the planks then  and give up  and it was all
i could do to keep from crying 




when they got aboard the king went for me  and shook me by the collar 
and says 

 tryin' to give us the slip  was ye  you pup!  tired of our company 
hey  

i says 

 no  your majesty  we warn't please don't  your majesty! 

 quick  then  and tell us what was your idea  or i'll shake the insides
out o' you! 

 honest  i'll tell you everything just as it happened  your majesty   the
man that had a-holt of me was very good to me  and kept saying he had a
boy about as big as me that died last year  and he was sorry to see a boy
in such a dangerous fix  and when they was all took by surprise by
finding the gold  and made a rush for the coffin  he lets go of me and
whispers  'heel it now  or they'll hang ye  sure!' and i lit out   it
didn't seem no good for me to stay i couldn't do nothing  and i didn't
want to be hung if i could get away   so i never stopped running till i
found the canoe  and when i got here i told jim to hurry  or they'd catch
me and hang me yet  and said i was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive
now  and i was awful sorry  and so was jim  and was awful glad when we
see you coming  you may ask jim if i didn't  

jim said it was so  and the king told him to shut up  and said   oh  yes 
it's mighty likely!  and shook me up again  and said he reckoned he'd
drownd me   but the duke says 

 leggo the boy  you old idiot!  would you a done any different   did you
inquire around for him when you got loose   i don't remember it  

so the king let go of me  and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
it  but the duke says 

 you better a blame' sight give yourself a good cussing  for you're the
one that's entitled to it most   you hain't done a thing from the start
that had any sense in it  except coming out so cool and cheeky with that
imaginary blue-arrow mark   that was bright it was right down bully  and
it was the thing that saved us   for if it hadn't been for that they'd a
jailed us till them englishmen's baggage come and then the
penitentiary  you bet! but that trick took 'em to the graveyard  and the
gold done us a still bigger kindness  for if the excited fools hadn't let
go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd a slept in our cravats
to-night cravats warranted to wear  too longer than we'd need 'em  

they was still a minute thinking  then the king says  kind of
absent-minded like 

 mf!  and we reckoned the niggers stole it! 

that made me squirm!

 yes   says the duke  kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic   we did  

after about a half a minute the king drawls out 

 leastways  i did  

the duke says  the same way 

 on the contrary  i did  

the king kind of ruffles up  and says 

 looky here  bilgewater  what'r you referrin' to  

the duke says  pretty brisk 

 when it comes to that  maybe you'll let me ask  what was you referring
to  

 shucks!  says the king  very sarcastic   but i don't know maybe you was
asleep  and didn't know what you was about  

the duke bristles up now  and says 

 oh  let up on this cussed nonsense  do you take me for a blame' fool 
don't you reckon i know who hid that money in that coffin  

 yes  sir!  i know you do know  because you done it yourself! 

 it's a lie!  and the duke went for him   the king sings out 

 take y'r hands off! leggo my throat! i take it all back! 

the duke says 

 well  you just own up  first  that you did hide that money there 
intending to give me the slip one of these days  and come back and dig it
up  and have it all to yourself  

 wait jest a minute  duke answer me this one question  honest and fair 
if you didn't put the money there  say it  and i'll b'lieve you  and take
back everything i said  

 you old scoundrel  i didn't  and you know i didn't   there  now! 

 well  then  i b'lieve you   but answer me only jest this one more now
don't git mad  didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
it  

the duke never said nothing for a little bit  then he says 

 well  i don't care if i did  i didn't do it  anyway   but you not only
had it in mind to do it  but you done it  

 i wisht i never die if i done it  duke  and that's honest   i won't say
i warn't goin' to do it  because i was  but you i mean somebody got in
ahead o' me  

 it's a lie!  you done it  and you got to say you done it  or  

the king began to gurgle  and then he gasps out 

 'nough! i own up! 

i was very glad to hear him say that  it made me feel much more easier
than what i was feeling before   so the duke took his hands off and says 

 if you ever deny it again i'll drown you   it's well for you to set
there and blubber like a baby it's fitten for you  after the way you've
acted  i never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything
 and i a-trusting you all the time  like you was my own father   you ought
to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot
of poor niggers  and you never say a word for 'em   it makes me feel
ridiculous to think i was soft enough to believe that rubbage   cuss you 
i can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit you wanted
to get what money i'd got out of the nonesuch and one thing or another 
and scoop it all! 

the king says  timid  and still a-snuffling 

 why  duke  it was you that said make up the deffisit  it warn't me  

 dry up!  i don't want to hear no more out of you!  says the duke    and
now you see what you got by it   they've got all their own money back 
and all of ourn but a shekel or two besides   g'long to bed  and don't
you deffersit me no more deffersits  long 's you live! 

so the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort 
and before long the duke tackled his bottle  and so in about a half an
hour they was as thick as thieves again  and the tighter they got the
lovinger they got  and went off a-snoring in each other's arms   they
both got powerful mellow  but i noticed the king didn't get mellow enough
to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again   that
made me feel easy and satisfied   of course when they got to snoring we
had a long gabble  and i told jim everything 




we dasn't stop again at any town for days and days  kept right along down
the river   we was down south in the warm weather now  and a mighty long
ways from home   we begun to come to trees with spanish moss on them 
hanging down from the limbs like long  gray beards   it was the first i
ever see it growing  and it made the woods look solemn and dismal   so
now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger  and they begun to work
the villages again 

first they done a lecture on temperance  but they didn't make enough for
them both to get drunk on   then in another village they started a
dancing-school  but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo
does  so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and
pranced them out of town   another time they tried to go at yellocution 
but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a
solid good cussing  and made them skip out   they tackled missionarying 
and mesmerizing  and doctoring  and telling fortunes  and a little of
everything  but they couldn't seem to have no luck   so at last they got
just about dead broke  and laid around the raft as she floated along 
thinking and thinking  and never saying nothing  by the half a day at a
time  and dreadful blue and desperate 

and at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time 
jim and me got uneasy   we didn't like the look of it   we judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever   we turned it over
and over  and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into
somebody's house or store  or was going into the counterfeit-money
business  or something  so then we was pretty scared  and made up an
agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such
actions  and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shake and clear out and leave them behind  well  early one morning we hid
the raft in a good  safe place about two mile below a little bit of a
shabby village named pikesville  and the king he went ashore and told us
all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if
anybody had got any wind of the royal nonesuch there yet  ( house to rob 
you mean   says i to myself   and when you get through robbing it you'll
come back here and wonder what has become of me and jim and the raft and
you'll have to take it out in wondering  ) and he said if he warn't back
by midday the duke and me would know it was all right  and we was to come
along 

so we stayed where we was   the duke he fretted and sweated around  and
was in a mighty sour way   he scolded us for everything  and we couldn't
seem to do nothing right  he found fault with every little thing 
something was a-brewing  sure   i was good and glad when midday come and
no king  we could have a change  anyway and maybe a chance for the
chance on top of it   so me and the duke went up to the village  and
hunted around there for the king  and by and by we found him in the back
room of a little low doggery  very tight  and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport  and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all
his might  and so tight he couldn't walk  and couldn't do nothing to
them   the duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool  and the king begun
to sass back  and the minute they was fairly at it i lit out and shook
the reefs out of my hind legs  and spun down the river road like a deer 
for i see our chance  and i made up my mind that it would be a long day
before they ever see me and jim again   i got down there all out of
breath but loaded up with joy  and sung out 

 set her loose  jim! we're all right now! 

but there warn't no answer  and nobody come out of the wigwam   jim was
gone!  i set up a shout and then another and then another one  and run
this way and that in the woods  whooping and screeching  but it warn't no
use old jim was gone   then i set down and cried  i couldn't help it 
but i couldn't set still long   pretty soon i went out on the road 
trying to think what i better do  and i run across a boy walking  and
asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so  and he says 

 yes  

 whereabouts   says i 

 down to silas phelps' place  two mile below here   he's a runaway
nigger  and they've got him   was you looking for him  

 you bet i ain't!  i run across him in the woods about an hour or two
ago  and he said if i hollered he'd cut my livers out and told me to lay
down and stay where i was  and i done it   been there ever since  afeard
to come out  

 well   he says   you needn't be afeard no more  becuz they've got him 
he run off f'm down south  som'ers  

 it's a good job they got him  

 well  i reckon!  there's two hunderd dollars reward on him   it's like
picking up money out'n the road  

 yes  it is and i could a had it if i'd been big enough  i see him
first  who nailed him  

 it was an old fellow a stranger and he sold out his chance in him for
forty dollars  becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait   think
o' that  now!  you bet i'd wait  if it was seven year  

 that's me  every time   says i    but maybe his chance ain't worth no
more than that  if he'll sell it so cheap   maybe there's something ain't
straight about it  

 but it is  though straight as a string   i see the handbill myself   it
tells all about him  to a dot paints him like a picture  and tells the
plantation he's frum  below newrleans   no-sirree-bob  they ain't no
trouble 'bout that speculation  you bet you   say  gimme a chaw tobacker 
won't ye  

i didn't have none  so he left   i went to the raft  and set down in the
wigwam to think   but i couldn't come to nothing   i thought till i wore
my head sore  but i couldn't see no way out of the trouble   after all
this long journey  and after all we'd done for them scoundrels  here it
was all come to nothing  everything all busted up and ruined  because
they could have the heart to serve jim such a trick as that  and make him
a slave again all his life  and amongst strangers  too  for forty dirty
dollars 

once i said to myself it would be a thousand times better for jim to be a
slave at home where his family was  as long as he'd got to be a slave 
and so i'd better write a letter to tom sawyer and tell him to tell miss
watson where he was   but i soon give up that notion for two things 
she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for
leaving her  and so she'd sell him straight down the river again  and if
she didn't  everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger  and they'd
make jim feel it all the time  and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced 
and then think of me!  it would get all around that huck finn helped a
nigger to get his freedom  and if i was ever to see anybody from that
town again i'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame   that's
just the way   a person does a low-down thing  and then he don't want to
take no consequences of it  thinks as long as he can hide  it ain't no
disgrace   that was my fix exactly   the more i studied about this the
more my conscience went to grinding me  and the more wicked and low-down
and ornery i got to feeling  and at last  when it hit me all of a sudden
that here was the plain hand of providence slapping me in the face and
letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up
there in heaven  whilst i was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that
hadn't ever done me no harm  and now was showing me there's one that's
always on the lookout  and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable
doings to go only just so fur and no further  i most dropped in my tracks
i was so scared   well  i tried the best i could to kinder soften it up
somehow for myself by saying i was brung up wicked  and so i warn't so
much to blame  but something inside of me kept saying   there was the
sunday-school  you could a gone to it  and if you'd a done it they'd a
learnt you there that people that acts as i'd been acting about that
nigger goes to everlasting fire  

it made me shiver   and i about made up my mind to pray  and see if i
couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy i was and be better   so i
kneeled down   but the words wouldn't come   why wouldn't they   it
warn't no use to try and hide it from him   nor from me  neither   i
knowed very well why they wouldn't come   it was because my heart warn't
right  it was because i warn't square  it was because i was playing
double   i was letting on to give up sin  but away inside of me i was
holding on to the biggest one of all   i was trying to make my mouth say
i would do the right thing and the clean thing  and go and write to that
nigger's owner and tell where he was  but deep down in me i knowed it was
a lie  and he knowed it   you can't pray a lie i found that out 

so i was full of trouble  full as i could be  and didn't know what to do 
at last i had an idea  and i says  i'll go and write the letter and then
see if i can pray   why  it was astonishing  the way i felt as light as a
feather right straight off  and my troubles all gone   so i got a piece
of paper and a pencil  all glad and excited  and set down and wrote 

miss watson  your runaway nigger jim is down here two mile below
pikesville  and mr  phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send 

huck finn 

i felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time i had ever
felt so in my life  and i knowed i could pray now   but i didn't do it
straight off  but laid the paper down and set there thinking thinking
how good it was all this happened so  and how near i come to being lost
and going to hell   and went on thinking   and got to thinking over our
trip down the river  and i see jim before me all the time   in the day
and in the night-time  sometimes moonlight  sometimes storms  and we
a-floating along  talking and singing and laughing   but somehow i
couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him  but only the
other kind   i'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n  'stead of
calling me  so i could go on sleeping  and see him how glad he was when i
come back out of the fog  and when i come to him again in the swamp  up
there where the feud was  and such-like times  and would always call me
honey  and pet me and do everything he could think of for me  and how
good he always was  and at last i struck the time i saved him by telling
the men we had small-pox aboard  and he was so grateful  and said i was
the best friend old jim ever had in the world  and the only one he's got
now  and then i happened to look around and see that paper 

it was a close place   i took it up  and held it in my hand   i was
a-trembling  because i'd got to decide  forever  betwixt two things  and
i knowed it   i studied a minute  sort of holding my breath  and then
says to myself 

 all right  then  i'll go to hell  and tore it up 

it was awful thoughts and awful words  but they was said   and i let them
stay said  and never thought no more about reforming   i shoved the whole
thing out of my head  and said i would take up wickedness again  which
was in my line  being brung up to it  and the other warn't   and for a
starter i would go to work and steal jim out of slavery again  and if i
could think up anything worse  i would do that  too  because as long as i
was in  and in for good  i might as well go the whole hog 

then i set to thinking over how to get at it  and turned over some
considerable many ways in my mind  and at last fixed up a plan that
suited me   so then i took the bearings of a woody island that was down
the river a piece  and as soon as it was fairly dark i crept out with my
raft and went for it  and hid it there  and then turned in   i slept the
night through  and got up before it was light  and had my breakfast  and
put on my store clothes  and tied up some others and one thing or another
in a bundle  and took the canoe and cleared for shore   i landed below
where i judged was phelps's place  and hid my bundle in the woods  and
then filled up the canoe with water  and loaded rocks into her and sunk
her where i could find her again when i wanted her  about a quarter of a
mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank 

then i struck up the road  and when i passed the mill i see a sign on it 
 phelps's sawmill   and when i come to the farm-houses  two or three
hundred yards further along  i kept my eyes peeled  but didn't see nobody
around  though it was good daylight now   but i didn't mind  because i
didn't want to see nobody just yet i only wanted to get the lay of the
land  according to my plan  i was going to turn up there from the
village  not from below   so i just took a look  and shoved along 
straight for town  well  the very first man i see when i got there was
the duke   he was sticking up a bill for the royal nonesuch three-night
performance like that other time   they had the cheek  them frauds!  i
was right on him before i could shirk   he looked astonished  and says 

 hel-lo!  where'd you come from    then he says  kind of glad and eager 
 where's the raft  got her in a good place  

i says 

 why  that's just what i was going to ask your grace  

then he didn't look so joyful  and says 

 what was your idea for asking me   he says 

 well   i says   when i see the king in that doggery yesterday i says to
myself  we can't get him home for hours  till he's soberer  so i went
a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait   a man up and offered
me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a
sheep  and so i went along  but when we was dragging him to the boat  and
the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
along  he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run  and we after
him   we didn't have no dog  and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out   we never got him till dark  then we
fetched him over  and i started down for the raft   when i got there and
see it was gone  i says to myself  'they've got into trouble and had to
leave  and they've took my nigger  which is the only nigger i've got in
the world  and now i'm in a strange country  and ain't got no property no
more  nor nothing  and no way to make my living ' so i set down and
cried   i slept in the woods all night   but what did become of the raft 
then  and jim poor jim! 

 blamed if i know that is  what's become of the raft   that old fool had
made a trade and got forty dollars  and when we found him in the doggery
the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what
he'd spent for whisky  and when i got him home late last night and found
the raft gone  we said  'that little rascal has stole our raft and shook
us  and run off down the river ' 

 i wouldn't shake my nigger  would i  the only nigger i had in the
world  and the only property  

 we never thought of that   fact is  i reckon we'd come to consider him
our nigger  yes  we did consider him so goodness knows we had trouble
enough for him   so when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke 
there warn't anything for it but to try the royal nonesuch another shake 
and i've pegged along ever since  dry as a powder-horn   where's that ten
cents  give it here  

i had considerable money  so i give him ten cents  but begged him to
spend it for something to eat  and give me some  because it was all the
money i had  and i hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday   he never
said nothing   the next minute he whirls on me and says 

 do you reckon that nigger would blow on us   we'd skin him if he done
that! 

 how can he blow   hain't he run off  

 no!  that old fool sold him  and never divided with me  and the money's
gone  

 sold him    i says  and begun to cry   why  he was my nigger  and that
was my money   where is he  i want my nigger  

 well  you can't get your nigger  that's all so dry up your blubbering 
looky here do you think you'd venture to blow on us   blamed if i think
i'd trust you   why  if you was to blow on us  

he stopped  but i never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before 
i went on a-whimpering  and says 

 i don't want to blow on nobody  and i ain't got no time to blow  nohow 
i got to turn out and find my nigger  

he looked kinder bothered  and stood there with his bills fluttering on
his arm  thinking  and wrinkling up his forehead   at last he says 

 i'll tell you something   we got to be here three days   if you'll
promise you won't blow  and won't let the nigger blow  i'll tell you
where to find him  

so i promised  and he says 

 a farmer by the name of silas ph   and then he stopped   you see  he
started to tell me the truth  but when he stopped that way  and begun to
study and think again  i reckoned he was changing his mind   and so he
was  he wouldn't trust me  he wanted to make sure of having me out of the
way the whole three days   so pretty soon he says 

 the man that bought him is named abram foster abram g  foster and he
lives forty mile back here in the country  on the road to lafayette  

 all right   i says   i can walk it in three days   and i'll start this
very afternoon  

 no you wont  you'll start now  and don't you lose any time about it 
neither  nor do any gabbling by the way   just keep a tight tongue in
your head and move right along  and then you won't get into trouble with
us  d'ye hear  

that was the order i wanted  and that was the one i played for   i wanted
to be left free to work my plans 

 so clear out   he says   and you can tell mr  foster whatever you want
to  maybe you can get him to believe that jim is your nigger some idiots
don't require documents leastways i've heard there's such down south
here   and when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus  maybe
he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting
'em out   go 'long now  and tell him anything you want to  but mind you
don't work your jaw any between here and there  

so i left  and struck for the back country   i didn't look around  but i
kinder felt like he was watching me   but i knowed i could tire him out
at that   i went straight out in the country as much as a mile before i
stopped  then i doubled back through the woods towards phelps'   i
reckoned i better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around  because i wanted to stop jim's mouth till these fellows could get
away   i didn't want no trouble with their kind   i'd seen all i wanted
to of them  and wanted to get entirely shut of them 




when i got there it was all still and sunday-like  and hot and sunshiny 
the hands was gone to the fields  and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
like everybody's dead and gone  and if a breeze fans along and quivers
the leaves it makes you feel mournful  because you feel like it's spirits
whispering spirits that's been dead ever so many years and you always
think they're talking about you   as a general thing it makes a body wish
he was dead  too  and done with it all 

phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations  and they
all look alike   a rail fence round a two-acre yard  a stile made out of
logs sawed off and up-ended in steps  like barrels of a different length 
to climb over the fence with  and for the women to stand on when they are
going to
